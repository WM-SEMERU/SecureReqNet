fa-search icon should not be displayed while loading unsafe scripts


Describe the issue you encountered: fa-search should not be displayed while loading unsafe scripts


Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?): Windows 10 32 bit


Brave Version (revision SHA): 0.13.3 RC1


Steps to reproduce:

Open https://mixed-script.badssl.com
Click the lock icon
Select "Load Unsafe Scripts"



Actual result: The fa-search icon is displayed and soon it is replaced with the unlock icon


Expected result: There could be two results



the fa-lock icon should be replaced as soon as scripts are loaded and executed (before onload is fired)
the fa-lock icon should be replaced after all of the scripts are loaded and executed

In my humble opinion the 1st one is better because attacker could intentionaly slow down downloading the other resources . CC @diracdeltas
Otherwise we could simply replace the icon when the buttons are pushed.
