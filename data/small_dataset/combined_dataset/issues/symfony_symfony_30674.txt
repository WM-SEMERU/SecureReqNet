This PR allows configuring scoped HTTP clients ("scoped_clients" replaces the previous "clients" options):
framework:
  http_client:
    max_host_connections: 4
    default_options:
      # ...
    scoped_clients:
      github_client:
        base_uri: https://api.github.com
        headers:
          Authorization: token abc123
          # ...
The base URI is turned into a scoping regular expression so that the token will be sent only when the github_client service is requesting the corresponding URLs.
When the base URI is too restrictive, the scope option can be used explicitly to define the regexp that URLs must match before any other options are applied.
All defined scopes are passed to a new scoping_http_client service, that can be used to hit endpoints with authentication pre-configured for several hosts. Its named autowiring alias is HttpClientInterface $scopingClient (this cannot be done with http_client as we want safe defaults, e.g. credentials should not be used implicitly when writing webhooks/crawlers.)
