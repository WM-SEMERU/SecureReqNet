After rolling-update nodes can't join cluster - DNS lookup fails to master host


1. What kops version are you running? The command kops version, will display
this information.
Version 1.11.1
2. What Kubernetes version are you running? kubectl version will print the
version if a cluster is running or provide the Kubernetes version specified as
a kops flag.
v1.11.8
3. What cloud provider are you using?
AWS
4. What commands did you run?  What is the simplest way to reproduce this issue?
I performed an upgrade from k8s 1.10.X to 1.11.8 using the rolling-updated cluster command.
5. What happened after the commands executed?
The nodes (master included) were recreated however the cluster is completely down. None of the nodes will join the cluster.
I should note that this was a gossip based cluster.

There seems to be a DNS and networking issue. When logging in to the nodes I see several relevant errors in the syslog:
Unable to update cni config: No networks found in /etc/cni/net.d/
Container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:docker: network plugin is not ready: cni config uninitialized
Get https://api.internal.xxxx.k8s.local/api/v1/services?limit=500&resourceVersion=0: dial tcp: lookup api.internal.xxxxx.k8s.local: no such host

Looking in the /etc/hosts file, the hostname for the master is not there:
127.0.1.1 ip-172-20-58-91.int.xxxx ip-172-20-58-91
127.0.0.1 localhost

6. What did you expect to happen?
I was hoping the upgrade would work.
7. Please provide your cluster manifest. Execute
kops get --name my.example.com -o yaml to display your cluster manifest.
You may want to remove your cluster name and other sensitive information.

8. Please run the commands with most verbose logging by adding the -v 10 flag.
Paste the logs into this report, or in a gist and provide the gist link here.
9. Anything else do we need to know?
