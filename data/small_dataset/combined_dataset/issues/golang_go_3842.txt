net/http: parent directory listing vulnerability


There's a pretty classic vulnerability in net/http that allows users to:

1. Get a file listing of any directory (despite index.html) via requests in the form
http://goserver/.%00/
2. Get a file listing of a *parent* directory via requests in the form
http://goserver/..%00/

This is not much, since I can't think of a way to traverse farther than a single parent
directory, or opening files in said directory, but file listings of any directory might
be quite severe for some.
