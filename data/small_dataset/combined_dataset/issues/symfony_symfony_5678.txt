UserProviderInterface loadByUsername method has a misleading name


From what i've seen in some custom user providers, this method is used also to load user by email, facebookId and other kind of identifier, so IMHO it has a somewhat misleading name.
I know this would create a backward compatibility break but i think it would be more appropriate to rename it to a more generic loadByIdentifier or something like that.
Directly from the doc: http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/entity_provider.html#authenticating-someone-with-a-custom-entity-provider . Here this method is used to load the user by username or by email.
