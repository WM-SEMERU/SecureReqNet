Sometimes (in random periods) gitlab can't merge all MergeRequests (Merge button inactive). In log we have the following error:
```
July 23, 2014 10:16 -> ERROR -> Command failed [1]: /usr/bin/git --git-dir=/home/git/gitlab-satellites/activebilling/core/.git checkout -b master origin/master

error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:

```
Our environment is:
Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS
GitLab 6.8.1
GitLab Shell 1.9.3
GitLab API v3
Ruby 2.0.0p353
Rails 4.0.3
```

Currently we resolve this issue by rebuilding satellites and reopen each MR. Any ideas how to fix this problem?
