From @HeahDude in #19819 (comment), I propose to store and retrieve Context objects per Request using SplObjectStorage.
At the moment, contexts are consumed by the Symfony\Components\Security\Http\Firewall class only, but they could be indirectly by end users if #19490 and/or #19819 come to be merged.
