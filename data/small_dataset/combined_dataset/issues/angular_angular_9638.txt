Current behavior
<img [srcset]="v"> with v='http://x.y.z 1x, javascript:foo() 2x' is only sanitized as a whole, not as two different URLs.
Expected/desired behavior
Should be sanitized to srcset="http://x.y.z 1x, unsafe:javascript:foo() 2x".
Reproduction of the problem

What is the expected behavior?
sanitization of all parts.
What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?
There's probably no risk of XSS, since srcset is a HTML5 tag, and only old browsers runs js in img srcs. However, that's still an URL, so if someone relies on a custom sanitizer for one thing or another, this will slip though. I don't think there's any hurry to fix this, though.
