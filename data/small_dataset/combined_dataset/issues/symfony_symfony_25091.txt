3.3.x



Add target user as $object parameter to SwitchUserListener's decide() call.  Providing the target user allows a security voter to fine-tune access control.  For example, a user with the role ROLE_ACCOUNT_MANAGER could be allowed to switch to ROLE_CUSTOMER, without giving the account manager too much access.
