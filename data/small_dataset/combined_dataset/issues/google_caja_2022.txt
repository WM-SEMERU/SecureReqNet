Improve support of CSS Color Module Level 4


Extends the <color> signature to

Allow named colors from CSS Color Module Level 4, including currentcolor.
Allow alpha channel in hexadecimal color notation (#FFF8, #33333333).
Support HSL and HSLA notations (Fixes #1918)

Internally, this adds definitions for <rgb-color>, <rgba-color>, <hsl-color> and <hsla-color>.
This is useful for better maintainability, keeping in sight the proposals to extend their syntax to accept space-separated arguments, as well as new color functions.
