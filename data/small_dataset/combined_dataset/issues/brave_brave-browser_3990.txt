NordVPN does not work in Private Mode


Description
NordVPN does not work in Private Mode
Steps to Reproduce

With a NordVPN account and the NordVPN extension, and the extension enabled for use in private windows, open a private window an attempt to connect to the service.
If you have not logged in on a normal tab, you will get prompted to login, and it will appear success, but not actually work.
If you have already logged in on a normal tab, you get a pop-up to enter your credentials. Entering your credentials returns you to the request to enter your credentials.
