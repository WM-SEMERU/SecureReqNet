Invalid content root is set in integration tests if they are in a subfolder and use WebApplicationFactory with inherited Startup


Describe the bug
I have found this during some investigation in #8428, so I use the same demo repository as an example.
The tests in the projects are failing when:

Test project is located in some subfolder.
WebApplicationFactory and inherited Startup class is used.

The exception si:

Message: System.ArgumentException : The content root '...\WebApiIntegrationTests\SubFolder_InheritedStartupTests_Workaround' does not exist.
Parameter name: contentRootPath

So it seems the framework set invalid content root path. The subfolder tests is missing in the middle. The correct path is: ...\WebApiIntegrationTests\tests\SubFolder_InheritedStartupTests_Workaround
When TestServer is used, everything works as expected regardless the location of the test project.
To Reproduce

Clone the demo repository, build it and run all the tests.
Observe following:

SubFolder_InheritedStartupTests and SubFolder_InheritedWebApplicationFactoryTests are failing. These test projects are in the tests subfolder.
SubFolder_TestServerTests are passing. These test projects are also in the tests subfolder.
TestServerTests, InheritedStartupTests and InheritedWebApplicationFactoryTests are all passing. These test projects are in the same folder as the SUT. The projects' location is the only difference here. (Please look here on _WithVersion and _Workaround projects.The projects without suffix are also failing here, but this is problem filed in the issue #8428.)



Expected behavior
Correct content root should be set and the tests should work. In the demo repository, all the SubFolder_ test projects should work.
