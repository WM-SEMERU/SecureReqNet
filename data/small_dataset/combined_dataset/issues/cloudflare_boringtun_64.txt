Missing check for message limits


A performance issue with message counters in #54 was closed via #59. However an explicit check for large message counters is still missing. To reiterate from #54:

The protocol defines the following message limits:

Rekey-After-Messages 2^64 * 2^16 - 1
Reject-After-Messages 2^64 − 2^4 − 1

Although unlikely in practice, the implementation must check that these message limits are not reached and avoid a counter wraparound. The implementation of ReceivingKeyCounterValidator in src/noise/session.rs must be updated to check this.

Note that it is practically very, very unlikely to reach these limits. However, it is possible for a malicious implementation to send packets with arbitrary high counter values. It would simplify code analysis if integer overflows can be ruled out by an explicit check.
