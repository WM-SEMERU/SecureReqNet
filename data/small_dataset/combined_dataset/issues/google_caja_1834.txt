Document canRepair: false


Original issue 1836 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-08-08T18:48:38.000Z:
In SES, some problems are marked canRepair: false, not because no possible repair exists, but because we no longer expect to see that problem and so the repair code is not worth keeping around (r5524).
I propose to add to every canRepair: false a comment explaining why no repair is present.
