Salt Minions should be authenticated


Before kube-up-ping a cluster, generate keys for nodes.
Turn off auto_accept on the master so master verifies the minions that want to join.
That way someone cannot spoof being a kubernetes master to the salt master and then get the master's keys (or, pretend to be a minion, though this will be less impactful when the master has policies installed to limit what actions minions are authorized to do.)
This could be obsoleted if @jbeda proposal #2303 is implemented first.
