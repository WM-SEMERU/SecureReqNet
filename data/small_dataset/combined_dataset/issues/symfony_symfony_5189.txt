Hello.
First, it will be useful to have this provider into the security component. Thanks to this, the feature will be available into silex application, and also drupal 8 and ezpublish 5.
I open a PR, but my work is not finished. It could be great to have an early feedback (not about CS, just about architecture)
I read the codebase of bundles available on http://knpbundles.com/search?q=ldap but there is some issues with these bundles:

Dependency on Zend\Ldap (opensky)
A global username / password account is not needed to check is a user is able to connect to ldap. (all bundle)
The factory are no enough flexible.

Of course, I will rebase / squash all my commits before final merge (if happen).
I am really not sure about      f40c85b
I tried to keep the default workflow of the user authentification
But with ldap, we can not retrieve user password. The only way to check if a user is in a ldap server, and if he is able to connect to the ldap, it is to try to connect the user against the ldap.
Then, we have an issue in src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DependencyInjection/Security/UserProvider/*Factory.php.
For exemple in https://github.com/lyrixx/symfony/blob/1834aaa11a9342455eaf30f1c6cd7ef69f951bdb/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DependencyInjection/Security/Factory/FormLoginFactory.php#L65 the $provider (AuthentificationProvider) is hardcoded. It should not be.
So, just for my test, i changed this value (this change breaks tests).
But we have to find a way to do this cleanly. How can we do that ?

(A) Duplicate the factory (Not ok with that)
(B) Add a new argument createAuthProvider
??

With A option, there will be lot of code.
With B option, we could add BC break.
