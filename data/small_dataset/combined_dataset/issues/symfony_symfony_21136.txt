When using UsernamePasswordJsonAuthenticationListener with LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle, we get a type exception

Type error: Argument 1 passed to Lexik\Bundle\JWTAuthenticationBundle\Security\Http\Authentication\AuthenticationSuccessHandler::handleAuthenticationSuccess() must implement interface Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface, string given, called in .../vendor/lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle/Security/Http/Authentication/AuthenticationSuccessHandler.php on line 47

This error occurs because the UsernamePasswordJsonAuthenticationListener send to the authentication success handler the token which have the user as a string and not the authenticated one that have a UserInterface as user.
