Hi,

I've recently upgraded from 6.9 to 7.2.1.

I ran an manual upgrade to 7.0 which went fine, and then tried the automatic update to 7.2 which failed because of a missing cmake.

I reverted to 7.0 and manually upgraded to 7.2.1. When I got to the migrations, I got a message saying "table already exists" for users_star_projects, labels and label_links. I had to manually drop those tables and then the migration proceeded.

Everything seemed to work, except today I've found we can't add new projects - we get the message "Can't save project. Please try again later".

Output from check suggests no errors:

	[deprecated] I18n.enforce_available_locales will default to true in the future. If you really want to skip validation of your locale you can set I18n.enforce_available_locales = false to avoid this message.

I see no mention of the event in application.log, nor any other of the log files.

No  project row gets created in the DB nor does the repository get created.

Any idea how to proceed?

Steven
