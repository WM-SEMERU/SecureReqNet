Variation in behavior of status code handlers with mixed Windows and anonymous auth


Describe the bug
I am trying to use mixed Windows and anonymous authentication for an application that is hosted in IIS. Controllers are decorated with [Authorize(nameof("UserGroup"))] with the exception of the home controller decorated with [AllowAnonymous] which contains an index view providing links and a status code handler view.
In Visual Studio 15.9.3 with anonymous disabled, both UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects and UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects work. Actual auth failures or errors are correctly rendered and the error parameter is passed to the action.
When anonymous  is enabled, I get spurious authentication errors for each request, however the site works if UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute is enabled but the page never renders correctly. The url is constructed correctly such as /Home/StatusCodeHandler/400 but the action never has the parameter bound. If UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects is enabled, nothing works as the initial auth failure always triggers it?
My app is configured as follows:
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    // app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute("/Home/StatusCodeHandler/{0}");
    app.UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects("/Home/StatusCodeHandler/{0}");
}
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy(nameof("UserGroup"), policy =>
        {
            policy.RequireAuthenticatedUser();
            policy.RequireRole("CN=...DC=example,DC=com");
        });
    });
    services.AddAuthentication(IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
Expected behavior
I assumed both handlers would behave the same. I have two issues, I want to use UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute but it doesn't function correctly in VS. I don't understand why the model binder works correctly when UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects is enabled, but I can't ever authenticate.
