[security] Removing UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener in favor of using the SimpleFormAuthenticationListener


Right now, the only difference between the UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener and the SimpleFormAuthenticationListener is the fact that the authentication provider can be injected. All other code inside is equal.
I think it would be fairly easy to remove the UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener altogether, and let the form_login factory insert the SimpleFormAuthenticationListener with a custom authentication provided that creates the UsernamePasswordToken.
This way, we could get rid of the whole UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener class, and the duplicated code.
