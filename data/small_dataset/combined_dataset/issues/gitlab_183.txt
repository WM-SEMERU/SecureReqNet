It is possible to register multiple emails in an account profile but when committing using the two emails the commits are shown as if they were from two different users.

The avatar is shown only for the primary email (including in the 'Network' view), repository stats do not merge the commits made by the same user using different emails.

It looks like the multiple emails are taken into account in the 'Graphs' view only.

It would be nice if we could get consistent behaviour regarding this accross all Gitlab views.

Cheers
