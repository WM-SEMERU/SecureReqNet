makeSealerUnsealerPair() should document plan interference hazard


Original issue 552 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-12T18:12:45.000Z:
makeSealerUnsealerPair() should probably document that calling unseal(box)
on a box you got from an untrusted source can potentially expose you to
plan interference hazard -- i.e., it can cause the execution of code
provided by the provider of box.
