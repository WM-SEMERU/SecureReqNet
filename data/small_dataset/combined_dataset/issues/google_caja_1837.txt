Safari 5 causing unexpected SES repair symptoms


Original issue 1839 created by erights on 2013-08-15T16:38:10.000Z:
See attached screenshots. Taken on a friend's computer, since I don't have one running Safari 5.
It may very well be that SES should be judged unsafe on Safari 5. But these problems, whatever they are, should at least be expected problems and so classified correctly.
Also, as the htmlservice screenshot shows, after falling back to es53 mode, we then encounter another problem,
TypeError: setting a property that has only a getter.
which it reports as coming from es53-taming-frame.opt.js:193, which is unfortunately minimized. Is there a way to run this test on unminimized sources?
