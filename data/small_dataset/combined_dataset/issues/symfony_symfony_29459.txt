Possible issue with unserialize in PHP 7.3


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4.19
Description
Upon upgrading to PHP 7.3, we run into issue with the unserialization of the user/token object when login.
The error is like this:

Notice: unserialize(): Error at offset 5859 of 13936 byte

The exact error happens in:
in vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Authentication/Token/AbstractToken.php (line 155)
How to reproduce
It seems like this is due to the serialized object contains object class inside it.
Not sure what changed in PHP 7.3 RC6, at first I thought it could be the unserialize now requires allowed_classes option to be set to true explicitly, I tried that by editing Symfony code but it didn't help
Possible Solution
Not a clue for now
Additional context
Everything was running fine on PHP 7.2 so it must be the changes in 7.3 RC6 that break things.
I attached here a sample of the string to unserialize:
