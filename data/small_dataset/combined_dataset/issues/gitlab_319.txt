I miss a feature to  have better protection on branches.

We have release branches, testing branches and production branches. I would like to have something to allow user group A to accept merge requests for release branches, user group B only to accept merge requests on testing branches and user group C only to accept merge requests on production branches.

The branches could be recognized by simple rules:
Release branches start with /release
Testing branches end with _T
Production branches end with _P
