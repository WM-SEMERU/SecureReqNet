[Security] Allow to disable scripts registration in HTTP APIs in a agent


Consul allow to activate healthcheck scripts using the enable-script-checks directive.
There are cases however were we would like to enable script for an agent, but protect any malicious usage of it from the HTTP API.
I propose to add the following change:

Introduction of enable-local-script-checks and enable-remote-script-checks. The former enabling script checks ONLY for checks defined in Consul configuration file, while the second would also enable script registration from HTTP API on the agent
Keep enable-script-checks which is the equivalent for enabling both enable-local-script-checksand enable-remote-script-checks

This would allow to use enable-local-script-checks on all our machines and thus keeping our healthchecks while enforcing security and keeping HTTP API.
A colleague of mine will provide soon a PR to implement this.
