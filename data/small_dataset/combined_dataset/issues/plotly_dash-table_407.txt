filtering syntax documentation


Is there a documentation for data-table filtering. For example, how to filter rows containing (or not containing) a substring? Thanks.
So far I found from dash user guide are
-- Enter eq "Asia" in the "continent" column
-- Enter > num(5000) in the "gdpPercap" column
-- Enter < num(80) in the lifeExp column
