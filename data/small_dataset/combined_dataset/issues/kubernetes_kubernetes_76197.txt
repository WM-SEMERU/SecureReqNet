Mark staging go module files as generated, add script to lint dependencies


What type of PR is this?
/kind cleanup
What this PR does / why we need it:

Makes diffs appear neater when they involve go.mod/go.sum changes in staging repos
Adds a script to list pinned dependencies that aren't used or do not match the natural preferred version, so we can see which should be updated
Fixes the pin-dependency.sh script to use go list to find the resolved version (when pinning to the naturally preferred version of a transitive dependency, the require directive is superfluous and is not included in the go.mod file explicitly, so go mod edit can't find it)
Prunes unused go.mod replace directives in staging go.mod files

NONE
