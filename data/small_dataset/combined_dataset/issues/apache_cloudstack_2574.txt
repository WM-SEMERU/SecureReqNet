[CLOUDSTACK-5235] ask users current password when they are executing a password update


Description
This is a long standing issue in Jira. It was asked for us to re-authenticate users with their old password when users execute a password update.
One thing to note though. Root/domain admins are able to update users password (users they have access to) without needing to provide the old password.
