Filtering doesn't work if column name has space [Sponsored: Due March 1]


Filtering on columns that contain a space in their name results in the filter string being considered as invalid.
After looking at the docs, it most likely is that the filter parser is being confused when turning the filter string into <column name> <operator> <value>
Temporary fix is, of course, removing spaces from column names.
