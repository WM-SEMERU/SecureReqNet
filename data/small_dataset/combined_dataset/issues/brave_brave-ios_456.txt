Qwant, Startpage links and popups do not work in private mode


We should handle window.open when in private mode
Enhancement for #446 & #455:
What
In private mode the WKProcessPool of the WKWebViewConfiguration is overridden to avoid passing of cookies and other data between WKWebViews. This behaviour when combined with a popup ie window.open results in a crash
Why
When a window.open is called the parent WKWebView calls the delegate method:
optional public func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, createWebViewWith configuration: WKWebViewConfiguration, for navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, windowFeatures: WKWindowFeatures) -> WKWebView?

in WKUIDelegate. It provides a configuration for the new window. When in private mode, this configuration is altered resulting in corruption of configuration and subsequent crash.
Current-Fix
For now all popups are blocked when in private mode. (BrowserViewController.swift)
See: #456 (comment)
Enhancement
Two possible solutions:

Keep blocking popups and instead show an alert telling the user of the reason.
Intercept popup call in private mode, create a new tab (not a popup) with the same request and return nil. (What other info needs to be used from the callback can be discussed later.)
