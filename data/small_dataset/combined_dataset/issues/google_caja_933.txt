jQuery expects "expando" attributes


Original issue 933 created by metaweta on 2008-11-20T23:48:20.000Z:
jQuery expects
myDiv.setAttribute('foo','bar')
to behave like
myDiv.foo = bar
even though foo is a property, not an attribute.  At the moment, we throw
an Error().
Should we keep this behavior, or fail silently, or set the property?
