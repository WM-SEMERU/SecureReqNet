crypto/tls: add PSK support


by tiebingzhang:
RFC 4279 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4279#page-10) added PSK to TLS.
OpenSSL and GnuTLS already have support for it.

The RFC defines three additional key exchange algorithms:
PSK
RSA-PSK
DHE-PSK

It would be nice to add at least PSK and DHE-PSK to GO's crypto/tls package. The work
seems to be reasonable size.

According to Wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TLS_implementations#Key_Exchange_Algorithms_.28Alternative_key-exchanges.29),
RSA-PSK has not been implemented by any of the listed implementations, so it is maybe
okay to push that one off for later.
