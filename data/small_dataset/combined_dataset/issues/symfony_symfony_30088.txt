Wrong deprecation message related to PHP templates


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2
Description
When using PHP templates instead of Twig templates, you must store them in src/Resources/views/. However, if you do that, you see a deprecation message telling you to store them in templates/.
Is this OK or should the deprecation message only be displayed for Twig templates?
