[RFC][DX][Form] Use the default EventDispatcher for form events


It can be quite confusing that one cannot configure an event listener or subscriber in services.yaml that listens to form events. I wonder why we do not use the default EventDispatcher instance for dispatching form events? Of course this only applies when forms are build using the FormFactory registered in the FrameworkBundle.
Two reasons why I believe form events should be dispatched using the default EventDispatcher instance:
1. Uniformity/DX
After learning how the Symfony event and form systems work a developer might assume the following works:
services:
    App\EventListener\FormPreSubmitListener:
        tags:
            - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: form.pre_submit }
2. Promote decoupled code
The observer pattern is all about decoupling code. However, right now there is no clear way to add EventListeners or -Subscriber to form classes without coupling the form class to the event listener. A workaround might be to create a form type extension which adds event subscribers but this results in quite some boilerplate code (See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48157630/3492835) and also inexperienced developers might feel more comfortable coupling the EventSubscribers to the form classes.
What do you think?
