Auto-generated Swagger.json from the Backend does not work with API Management


The ASP.NET Core Backend is generating a Swagger.json file using Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.

When importing this Swagger File into Azure API Management, it is throwing errors! As a workaround, we currently have provided fixed JSON files as Assets, but it would be nice, if participants could just import that Swagger.json URL.
