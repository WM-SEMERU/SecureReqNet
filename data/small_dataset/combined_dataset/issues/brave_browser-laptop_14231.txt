Toggling shields breaks the security indicator on URLs with hash


Test plan
See #14232
Original issue description
Description
The security indicator in the address bar is sometimes incorrect for https://mail.google.com while the user is logged in. The icon should be a gray closed lock, indicating a secure connection, but sometimes it is a red open lock. Toggling shields on or off reliably causes the incorrect red open lock icon to be shown.
Steps to Reproduce

Log in to Gmail (https://mail.google.com) in Brave
Observe the (correct) gray closed lock icon for the secure origin
Toggle shields
Observe the (incorrect) red open lock icon for the secure origin
