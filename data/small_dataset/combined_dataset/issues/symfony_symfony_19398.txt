With this, the FirewallContext class now has a getConfig() method returning a FirewallConfig object representing the firewall configuration.
Also this adds a getFirewallConfig() method to the FirewallMap class of the SecurityBundle.
In a next time, this could be useful to display some firewall related informations to the Profiler, as pointed out in #15294.
Also, it can be useful to be able to access the current firewall configuration from an AuthenticationListener, especially for third party bundles (I can develop on demand).
