Looks like AMBARI-24319  added this bug when trying to fix another bug. The mentioned bugfix addressed the situation when we regenerate keytabs for some service, and accidentally regenerate referenced shared keytabs. As a result, other services that are using these shared keytabs are facing issue with authentication.
Existing implementation never regenerates referenced keytabs. Since code only goes through "services" at kerberosDescriptor, and never descends into "identities", entries at "identities" are never regenerated.
Current patch will check if a request is "regenerate_keytabs=all", and in this case, it would add entries from "identities" to a list of keytabs that are regenerated
How was this patch tested?
unit tests, manual  check on a live cluster
NOTE: Current patch intersects with changes from #2802 . I've rebased against these changes, and am currently checking if the patch still works
