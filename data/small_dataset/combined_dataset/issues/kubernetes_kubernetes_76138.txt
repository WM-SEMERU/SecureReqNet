Share Process Namespace for Deployments


What would you like to be added:
Trying to
Share Process Namespace using Deployments. The example refers to a Pod definition using apiversion v1 I am not sure why this is not working as expected.
example config
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: depname
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      namespace: myn
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: mysa
      shareProcessNamespace: true
      containers:
      - name: shell
        image: busybox
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
              - SYS_PTRACE
        stdin: true
        tty: true
        volumeMounts:
        - name: scripts
          mountPath: /scripts
      - name: myapp
        image: docker.io/geekodour/app:latest
      volumes:
      - name: scripts
        configMap:
          name: scriptsconfig
          defaultMode: 0744
      nodeSelector:
        cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool: mynodepool
Why is this needed:
I think this only works for Pod declarations, make it work on deployments (apps/v1). I will be happy to work on this if really is an issue because I am not sure If I am doing this right.
