Fix URL parsing consistency issue


Fix #10270 by preferring muon.url.parse over Node's legacy (and non-standards compliant) URL parser. This is subobtimal because unit tests are running a different URL parser from the actual browser, but seems like the best trade off for now.
Also fixes #6098
Test Plan:
