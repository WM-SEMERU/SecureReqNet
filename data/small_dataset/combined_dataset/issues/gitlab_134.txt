When the author of a commit is listed in the group members of a project, he does not receive note notifications.
In the notification service, `node.commit_author` is called to get the user info.
To fix this issue i patched my code of `commit_author` function in the note model like this :

```ruby
  def commit_author
    @commit_author ||=
      project.users.find_by_email(noteable.author_email) ||
      project.users.find_by_name(noteable.author_name) ||
      project.group.users.find_by_email(noteable.author_email) ||
      project.group.users.find_by_name(noteable.author_name)
  rescue
    nil
  end
```
