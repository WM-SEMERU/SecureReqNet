Check pvc spec if it already existed in StatefulSet, update when it is not bound


What type of PR is this?
/kind feature
What this PR does / why we need it:
Currently, statefulSet controller would update pvc when pvc already existed. However,  update it when it is not bound may be more reasonable. Following case can be avoid.
1 PVC named www-web-test-0  already, but unused and not bound. like this:
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: www-web-test-0
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: **test**
  volumeMode: Filesystem

2 A StatefulSet is created, like this. Then the pvc would not be updated, a pod can not be created
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: web-test
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  serviceName: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
          name: www
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
      securityContext: {}
