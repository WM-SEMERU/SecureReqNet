Add 18 and over category in taxonomy


Issue: Need to support LDA and other similar categories for targeting purposes.
Feature needs:

add a 18 and over master node to the taxonomy
the 18 and over node is always set to true (BR requires user to be 17+)

During the implementation of the user feedback feature, the user can opt out of the 17+ flag as a choice and should never be shown 17+ ads.
On the server end, all appropriate ads should automatically select 17+ flag based on the campaign/creative combo.
