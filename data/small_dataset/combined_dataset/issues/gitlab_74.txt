When Alice makes a merge request for her white rabbit app and asks Bob to do this and Bob executes the request, both Alice and Bob receive two emails of the merge being done.
Also, when there is a third party named Danny, who is merger by profession and is nor reporter or asignee, when he merges a merge request from Bob or Alice, both will receive 2 emails and Danny will not receive any mail.
Expected behaviour : only 1 email to merge requester and executer and perhaps an email to Danny in the second scenario.
