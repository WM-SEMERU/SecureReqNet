Implement an IP blacklist and whitelist


We need an IP and URL blacklist to prevent scans from happening on IP ranges and domains that are invalid. For example localhost.local, 127.0.0.1 or 10.10.0.2.
It is important that we also resolve a target URL to its IP before we run a scan. Otherwise people could submit valid looking domains like foo.bar.com which actually simply are pointing to an invalid IP address.
Ideally this list lives in a configuration file that is shared by backend and frontend. For example something like /etc/minion/global.json.
