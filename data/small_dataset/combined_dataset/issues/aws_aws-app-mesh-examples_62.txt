External Routing (HTTP/TCP with TLS)


I can't find it in the documentation, but is it possible to have routing to an external service?  Meaning I have appmesh in place and the container/microservice needs to connect to an externally managed service like gitlab?  I added the URL as a backend to the virtual node but whenever it attempts to connect I get this error:
ENVOY LOG:

POD LOG:

Connecting to this service works if I'm not using appmesh.
