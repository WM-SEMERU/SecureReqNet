Update calls to Process.Start


Unless we're launching the interpreter that the user typed in, we should be making sure to use full paths when launching executable.
Example of one that needs to be updated:



PTVS/Python/Product/EnvironmentsList/EnvironmentPathsExtension.xaml.cs


         Line 81
      in
      1d04f01






 Process.Start(psi); 





We can use Path.Combine(Environment.SystemDirectory, "explorer.exe") to specify the full path.
Alternative: string filepath= "%WINDIR%\\system32\\explorer.exe"; Environment.ExpandEnvironmentVariables(filepath);
