Upstream go security issue with crypto/elliptic


Yesterday, the golang team released go 1.7.6 and go 1.8.2 to address a security issue involving the crypto/elliptic package. There is currently no known exploit, but as we have dependencies on this package in kubernetes, we should upgrade the versions of go we are using.
Details are here:
golang/go#20040
As we are updating master/1.7 to use go 1.8.3 (#45216 (comment)), I don't think we need any specific action there. However, we should probably update 1.5 and 1.6 to use go 1.7.6.
The kubernetes security team is aware of this issue, and is okay with a public issue on it as details are already public.
