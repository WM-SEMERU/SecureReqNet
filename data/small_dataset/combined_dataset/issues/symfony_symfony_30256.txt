Var-dumper; easily copy text shown on hover


When I use dump() to display a class, the full class name can be shown when hovering the first element. Copying this part isn't possible in a browser. Could an method be added so one can copy this text shown in the hover?
In the screenshot, it's the marked text.

NB This request holds for all the data that's shown in a hover.
