Include the Safe* interfaces in the exports of @angular/platform-browser


After reading #8491, I tried to implement the solution to mark the generated style string as safe.
this.svgUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustStyle('url(\'image.svg\')');
However, bypassSecurityTrustStyle() returns SafeStyle instead of string (as the comment suggests) and this marker interface isn't exported by @angular/platform-browser. That means, I cannot properly type my class member.
Please export the marker interfaces SafeStyle, SafeHtml, etc. so this solution works without any.
