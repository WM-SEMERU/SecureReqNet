I have added @uses tags to indicate that the Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\AccessDecisionManager::decide() method's code is using the methods decideAffirmative(), decideConsensus() and decideUnanimous(). This will help humans, IDEs and other analysis tools to detects usages of these methods.
