ConvertTo-HPOVPowerShellScript for SPT and JBODs creation not working as expected


Tests performed with the latest HPOV PowerShell library, SPT and ConvertTo-HPOVPowerShellScript cmdlet.
*SPT is configured with two JBODs (on SAS Mezz 1 storage controller in HBA mode),  UEFI optimized boot mode, BIOS setting to max power performance, 4 connections)
Two things are not working:

In the generate PowerShell  at the very end row in the New-HPOVServerProfileTemplate parameters:


is generated parameter name –BootSettings instead of BiosSetting
are missing “-ManageBoot $manageboot -BootMode $biosBootMode”, despite that  both variables $manageboot and $biosBootMode are correctly defined and assign the right values to them in the first part of the generated script

Here details:
Generated and not working:
------------ Attributes for advanced settings
New-HPOVServerProfileTemplate -Name $name -Description $description -ServerProfileDescription $spdescription  -ServerHardwareType $sht -EnclosureGroup $eg -Affinity $affinity -Connections $connections -LocalStorage -StorageController $controllers -BootOrder $bootOrder -Bios -BootSettings $biosSettings -HideUnusedFlexNics $true
Manually modified to work (in red are the modification in green are the additions):
----------- Attributes for advanced settings
New-HPOVServerProfileTemplate -Name $name -Description $description -ServerProfileDescription $spdescription  -ServerHardwareType $sht -EnclosureGroup $eg -Affinity $affinity -Connections $connections -LocalStorage -StorageController $controllers -ManageBoot $manageboot -BootMode $biosBootMode -BootOrder $bootOrder -Bios -BiosSettings $biosSettings -HideUnusedFlexNics $true
Note: I did the above modification in the generated script and created successfully an SPT but hit a second issue (decripbed bellow)

Wrong disk number in one of the JBODs


The two JBODs (“Capacity” and “Cache”) in the existing (original) SPT contains respectively 3 and 2 disks but in the SPT created with the auto generated script the both JBODs (“Capacity” and “Cache”)  are with 2 disk each

Json from the original SPT:  “existing_SPT.json”

Automatically Generated PowerShell from the original SPT with the above described manual modification:  “test_modified_and_working.ps1”
