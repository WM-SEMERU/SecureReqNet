Documentation is too coupled to the MakerBundle


I just got feedback from someone trying to follow Symfony docs, but they didn't want to use the maker bundle. Now, myself I haven't read the docs since 2.0 was released, so I can't judge for myself, but their feedback was it was impossible to learn from 4.x docs. He started getting somewhere only after they switched to 3.x branch.
Specifically, they were trying to set up and configure authentication, but this might be an issue in other places too.
Other people on slack seem to have had similar issues:
