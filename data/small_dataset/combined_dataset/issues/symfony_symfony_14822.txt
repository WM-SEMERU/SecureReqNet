[Security][bug] Remember-me cookie with custom `secure`/`httponly` options is not cleared on logout


AbstractRememberMeServices does not pass secure/httponly options when it clears the cookie on logout: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.3/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/RememberMe/AbstractRememberMeServices.php#L296

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.3/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/RememberMe/PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices.php#L105
