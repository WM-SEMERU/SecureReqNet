This PR reworks some parts of #19398 for solving issues like #20585 about accessing the firewall configs in different ways.
The main entry point for getting firewall configs becomes the security.firewall.config_registry service.
FirewallMap & FirewallContext stay unchanged, as they are more about the security execution context than getting the configuration.
It also removes the deprecation introduced in FirewallContext (and even in case this one is not merged, I'd like to challenge this deprecation which seems superfluous instead of simply allowing null)
However, if the only real uses-cases are only to access the config at runtime from the firewall name, we may not need that "complexity" and refactoring (see #20592 instead).
WDYT?
