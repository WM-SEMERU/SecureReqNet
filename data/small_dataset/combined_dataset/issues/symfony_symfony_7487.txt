[Security] error when switching back from the same impersonated user


Let's say I'm logged in as user A, then switch into user A. Now switching back to the originating user results in an error:
Argument 2 passed to Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Event\SwitchUserEvent::__construct() must implement interface Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface, string given, called in vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/SwitchUserListener.php on line 159 and defined in vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Event/SwitchUserEvent.php line 24
This happens for me in 2.1.9-dev (18cd187 currently) and only if it's about the same user. Maybe 2.0.x is also affected.
SwitchUserEvent expects a UserInterface for the 2nd argument, but receives the user's password hash.
