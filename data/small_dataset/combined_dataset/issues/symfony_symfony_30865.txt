[DI] Have a better DX for excluded resources


Description
This configuration  does not scale very well.
We end up creating smaller section by feature.
AppBundle\Feature\:
    resource: '../../../src/Feature/*'
But At some point, it becomes complicated to maintain and we finish with something like:
AppBundle\Feature\:
    resource: '../../../src/Feature/*'
    exclude: '../../../src/Feature/{Model,Foobar.php,Bar/Bar.php,James/James.php,James/Url.php,James/Link.php,James/Queue.php,James/Download.php}'
Instead, I could be nice to be able to use such syntax:
AppBundle\Feature\:
    resource: '../../../src/Feature/*'
    exclude:
        - '../../../src/Feature/Model/
        - '../../../src/Feature/Foobar.php
        - '../../../src/Feature/James/{James.php,Url.php,Link.php,Queue.php,Download.php}'

So to make it simple:
excludes should accept a string or an array of string.
WDYT ?
