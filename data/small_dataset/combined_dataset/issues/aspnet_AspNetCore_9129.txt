Change default LanguageVersion to Latest prior to 3.0 RTM


In runtime compilation, we need to assume LangVersion.Preview during 3.0-preview releases when no value is specified in the deps file.
Prior to RTM, this needs to be changed to LangVersion.Latest. This matches Roslyn's versioning strategy.
