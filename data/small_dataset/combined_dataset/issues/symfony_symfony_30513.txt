When a response completed, streaming it again yields no chunks right now.
This PR makes it yield a LastChunk - or an ErrorChunk when applicable.
The reasoning for the previous behavior was that streams should yield only activity from the network.
But this looks more complex to use in practice. The proposed behavior is simpler to reason about I think.
