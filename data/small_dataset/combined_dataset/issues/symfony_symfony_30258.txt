Currently the ObjectNormalizer loses type information for nested arrays in its properties, resulting in failed denormalization
Basically if i have this property
/** @var Child[][] */
public $children;
The ObjectNormalizer just sees this as a 'array' type and injects the raw array, rather than passing it back to the Serializer with class Child[][]
