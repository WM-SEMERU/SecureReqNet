This should help whenever:

the token does not implement the getProviderKey method
you've got multiple firewalls sharing a same context but a logout listener only defined on one of them.

Behavior:

When not providing the firewall key:

Try to find the key from the token (unless it's an anonymous token)
If found, try to get the listener from the key. If the listener is found, stop there.
Try from the injected firewall key. If the listener is found, stop there.
Try from the injected firewall context. If the listener is found, stop there.

The behavior remains unchanged when providing explicitly the firewall key. No fallback.
