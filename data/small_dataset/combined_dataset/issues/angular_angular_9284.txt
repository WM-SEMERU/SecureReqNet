feat(security): fail more detectably when using a safe value in interpolation


If a user ends up with a safe value in an interpolation context, that's probably
a bug. Returning "SafeValue must use [property]= binding" will make it easier
to detect and correct the situation. Detecting the situation and throwing an
error for it could cause performance issues, so we're not doing this at this
point (but might revisit later).
Part of #8511 and #9253.
