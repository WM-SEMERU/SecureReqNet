'### Summary

The title of a private project snippet can be leaked to non-project members when the snippet is referenced.

### Steps to reproduce

1. In a public project (e.g. https://gitlab.com/rabbitfang/gitlab-bug-test), create a private snippet (any content and title).
2. Somewhere on GitLab where Markdown references are rendered, link to the created snippet (e.g. rabbitfang/gitlab-bug-test$33967)
3. Either save the comment/issue/MR, or just preview the rendered markdown.
4. ???
5. Profit (e.g. launch the nukes)

### Expected behavior

The linked snippet is rendered as plain text without linking to the snippet or having hover text giving the snippet's title.

### Actual behavior

The private snippet is linked and the title is available in a tooltip.
