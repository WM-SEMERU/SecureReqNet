Kubernetes pod and namespace security model


This proposed update to docs/design/security.md includes proposals
on how to ensure containers have consistent Linux security behavior
across nodes, how containers authenticate and authorize to the master
and other components, and how secret data could be distributed to
pods to allow that authentication.
References concepts from #3910, #2030, and #2297 as well as upstream issues
around the Docker vault and Docker secrets.
Pulled together to frame the discussion from #3910 as a cross Kubernetes
concept as per @erictune
