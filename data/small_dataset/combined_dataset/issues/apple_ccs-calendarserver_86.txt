Some proposed patches regarding configuration:

The config.py variables CreateAccounts and ResetAccountACLs seem to be used. Remove them.
The config.py variable AdminPrincipals contains an old-style .../users/... value. Convert to .../user/...
The config.py variable SSLOnly is not yet used. This could result in an unexpectedly open non-SSL service. Don't bind this service if SSLOnly is true.
