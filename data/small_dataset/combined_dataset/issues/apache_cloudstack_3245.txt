[WIP DO NOT MERGE] server: allows compute offering with or without constraints


Description
Problem: Custom compute offering does not allow setting min and max values for CPU and VRAM for custom VMs.
Root Cause: Custom compute offerings cannot be created with a given range of CPU number and memory instead it allows only fixed values.
Solution: createServiceOffering API has been modified to allow setting a defined range for CPU number and memory. Also, UI form for compute offering creation is provided with a new field named 'compute offering typeâ€™ with values - Fixed, Custom Constrained, Custom Constrained. It will allow creation of compute offerings either with a fixed CPU speed and memory for fixed compute offering, or with a range of CPU number and memory range for custom constrained compute offering or without predefined CPU number, CPU speed and memory for custom unconstrained compute offering.
To allow user to set CPU number, CPU speed and memory during VM deployment, UI form for VM deployment has been modified to provide controls to change these values. These controls are depicted in screenshots below for custom constrained and custom unconstrained compute offering types.
