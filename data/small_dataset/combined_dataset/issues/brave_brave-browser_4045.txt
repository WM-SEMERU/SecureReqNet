Wrong twitch channel linked in Auto-Contribute


Description
Wrong twitch channel linked in the Auto-Contribute section of brave://rewards.
Steps to Reproduce

Pick a twitch channel which has a name terminating witch certain strings. My current assumption is the string having to end with _ (underscore) followed by none or more digits, but this assumption is not easy to test without creating new twitch channels. If you want to be sure you have a name which will reproduce the bug, you can use anatomyz_2, the channel with which I originally encountered it.
Make sure you have Auto-Contribute enabled. I recommend changing your settings to 1 visit and 1 minute so you won't have to wait too long.
Watch a video or stream on your chosen twitch channel long enough (depending on your settings) for it to be included in Auto-Contribute.
Go to brave://rewards, navigate to Auto-Contribute and click on the name of the twitch channel you just watched

Actual result:
Links to the twitch channel with the initial part of the name (ie. the part before the underscore). For our example channel, it links to https://www.twitch.tv/anatomyz/videos
Expected result:
Links to the the twitch channel you watched. Example: Links to https://www.twitch.tv/anatomyz_2/videos
Reproduces how often:
For a fixed channel, every time you click the link (10/10).
For different channels, reproducing it is more annoying, as you need to either find or create such channels, and channel search of twitch does not seem support underscore. So far, I only found one other channel (leagueofladies_) which has a fitting name and encountered the bug with that channel as well. If there are letters after the underscore, everything works fine

Additional Information
The correct channel name does appear in the list, only the link is wrong. I have no idea if the contribution itself goes to the correct channel or not though.
