reducing time for the ref headers fetch at startup


Test plan

download 0.23.104
create an empty brave profile and add promoCode which includes dowjones-barrons or dowjones-marketwatch
launch brave, you should see a dj-barrons or dj-marketwatch tab at startup

Original Issue
Description
Because of #14620, we fetch the headers anywhere between 30s -1min after startup. Because of this change, users won't see the promotion tab at startup when installing either MW/Barrons (dowjones promotion). Users might not wait the 1min and just assume that the promotion is either over or broken.
Steps to Reproduce

Download one of the promotional executables from either https://brave.com/dowjones-barrons or https://brave.com/dowjones-marketwatch
Once downloaded, install the build and launch Brave
Wait 30s - 1min and you'll notice the promotional tab will finally appear

Actual result:

Expected result:
Promotional tabs should appear a few seconds after startup and not 30s -1min after startup. Might give the users the impressing that it's either broken or the promotion has ended.
