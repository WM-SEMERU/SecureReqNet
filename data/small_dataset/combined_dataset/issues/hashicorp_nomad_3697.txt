Web UI only works on leader server


Nomad version
Nomad v0.7.1 (0b295d399d00199cfab4621566babd25987ba06e)
Operating system and Environment details
Ubuntu Xenial on AMD64.
Issue
I’m using ACLs.
I’m trying to access the Web UI but on every server and client except for the leader, the UI flashes shortly and then I get a
Server Error

A server error prevented data from being sent to the client.


error message before being able to enter a token.  I’ve tried Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.
The browser console looks like this:

The only relevant log messages on the server side is these two:
Dec 28 19:48:03 c-0175 nomad-server[232]:     2017/12/28 19:48:03.879031 [ERR] http: Request /v1/nodes, error: rpc error: Permission denied

It’s unfortunate because I would like to use https://nomad.service.consul:4646 as the canonical URL (AFAIK, it’s impossible to determine the leader using a tag like with Vault?).
Interestingly, the API works just fine – I’m not getting any errors when using the nomad CLI client with NOMAD_ADDR set to https://nomad.service.consul:4646

Is this behaviour intended or documented?  I don’t seem to be able to find anything on Google or GitHub which is deeply confusing me.

FTR, a successful request looks like this:

in the browser.
Reproduction steps

have more than 1 nomad server
activated ACLs
anonymous has no policy
try to access web ui on a server that isn’t the leader
