paranoid strategy for client-side setInnerHtml


Original issue 607 created by felix8a on 2008-06-13T22:35:36.000Z:
given a string of assumed html,
create a parse tree of that html while sanitizing.
when it passes sanitization,
assign it to innerhtml of an unattached node.
then walk the resulting node tree,
verifying that it matches the expected structure
as recorded by your parse tree.
if it mismatches, then you have a bug in the sanitizer,
or an unexpected quirk of the browser.
