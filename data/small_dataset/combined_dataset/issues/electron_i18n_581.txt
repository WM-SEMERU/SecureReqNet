build(deps): [security] bump handlebars from 4.0.12 to 4.1.0


Bumps handlebars from 4.0.12 to 4.1.0. This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The npm Advisory Database.

Prototype Pollusion
All versions of handlebars are vulnerable to Prototype Pollusion. Templates may alter an Objects' prototype, thus allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
Affected versions: <=4.0.12



Changelog
Sourced from handlebars's changelog.

v4.1.0 - February 7th, 2019
New Features

import TypeScript typings - 27ac1ee

Security fixes:

disallow access to the constructor in templates to prevent RCE - 42841c4, #1495

Housekeeping

chore: fix components/handlebars package.json and auto-update on release - bacd473
chore: Use node 10 to build handlebars - 78dd89c
chore/doc: Add more release docs - 6b87c21

Compatibility notes:
Access to class constructors (i.e. ({}).constructor) is now prohibited to prevent
Remote Code Execution. This means that following construct will no work anymore:
class SomeClass {
}

SomeClass.staticProperty = 'static'

var template = Handlebars.compile('{{constructor.staticProperty}}');
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = template(new SomeClass());
// expected: 'static', but now this is empty.

This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described in #1495. We will not increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version and the issue may not be resolved on many systems).
