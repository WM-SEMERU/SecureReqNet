### Problem
The problem is there's currently not a perfect or boring solution for mitigating both BREACH and HEIST while using compression. This is in response to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33719.

### Proposal
For a first step, I propose that we add the same-site attribute to all cookies which are set. Ideally this should be for both self-hosted and gitlab.com.
