ipcRenderer events are not received inside iframes


messages sent by this.webview.send are not received by brave-default.js running inside an iframe. as a result, ads are not replaced in https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/brave/slashdot.html and fingerprinting protection will not always work inside iframes.
i would expect the top-level instance of brave-default.js to forward the messages onto subframes.
blocks #313 somewhat, but can be worked around
