[WIP DO NOT MERGE] api: instance and template details are free text


Problem: Users don't know what keys/values to enter for template and VM details.
Root Cause: The feature does not exist that can list possible details and options.
Solution: Based on the possible VM and template details handled by the
codebase, those details were refactored and a list API is introduced
that can return users those details along with possible values. When
users add details now, they will be presented with a list of key details
and their possible options if any.
Introduces a new API:
listDetailOptions: Lists all possible details and their options for a resource type such as a VM or a template
Required params: resourcetype, 
API Params               Type     Description
==========               ====     ===========
resourceid               string   the UUID of the resource (optional)
resourcetype             string   the resource type such as UserVm, Template etc.
