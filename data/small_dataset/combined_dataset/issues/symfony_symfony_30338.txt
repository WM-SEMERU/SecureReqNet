When I throw a NotFoundException within a controller I get a http 200 Ok status code


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.3
Description
I have a single front controller that receives all the requests. For each request it gather's some data an decide if there should be a response or a not found 404 response. I have done this using
throw            $this->createNotFoundException();
and this
throw new NotFoundHttpException();
and this
new Response('Not found', 404);
but in all cases the http status code is 200.
How to reproduce
Symply create a controller that throws a NotFoundHttpException() and visit the url.
Additional context
I need an accurate response code in order to be able to use accurate cache rules in my reverse cache proxy and run some acceptance tests.
