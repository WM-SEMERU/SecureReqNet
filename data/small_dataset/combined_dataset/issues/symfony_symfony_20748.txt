Simpler roles check in AuthorizationVoters


Using Symfony 3.2 with FosUserBundle and needing to check the roles in a voter I followed the instructions in the documentation. http://symfony.com/doc/master/security/voters.html#checking-for-roles-inside-a-voter
Warming up the cache in the dev environment workes and the voter seems to work aswell.
In "prod" on the other hand, I get this one:

[Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Exception\ServiceCircularReferenceException]
Circular reference detected for service "security.access.decision_manager",
path: "cache_warmer -> twig -> security.authorization_checker -> security.
access.decision_manager".

Checking roles from inside a voter could be a lot simpler with just checking them against the token instead of having to inject the decisionManager.
But this isn't that easy as long as we use a role hierarchy. Checking against each of the roles in the hierarchy is a hack I would like not to add.
Could it be possible to add access to the calculated ("expanded"?) hierarchy from the token? This could be done in the login process to avoid having to calculate each time.
