Authentication is not clearly explained


I think that Authentication part is not very well explained.
For example I am not clear what is login_check doing or what to do with the login listener since there is already an abstract authentication listener.
In general the security part is very hard to understand or the explanations are incomplete in the documentation and sometimes FOSUserBundle is not enough.
