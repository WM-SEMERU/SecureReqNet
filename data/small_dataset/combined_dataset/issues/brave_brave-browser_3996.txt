32-bit Brave eats most of the memory in Windows 7


Description
When starting the Brave browser, looking at resource utilization, it eats most of the 4GBs of the RAM (the maximum a i386 processor can handle). Windows will resort to paging at this point.
Steps to Reproduce

Open Brave browser on Windows 7 Enterprise in 32-bit with 4GB RAM
Open Task Manager
Observe RAM usage

Actual result:
Your memory usage will have a big spike when Browser inits, then spikes down when closed.

Expected result:
Acceptable memory usage (Chrome and Chromium has 90% lesser usage in 32-bits)
Reproduces how often:
Easily reproduced
Brave version (brave://version info)
73.0.62.50
Reproducible on current release:

Website problems only:
