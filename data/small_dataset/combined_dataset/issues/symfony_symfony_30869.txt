Doc PR




The Constraint::getDefaultOption() method is documented with a return type of string, but has no return statement. This behaviour is expected, as the return value is compared against null elsewhere in the code, but the docblock causes problems with static analysis when extending this class.
This PR corrects the documented return type to string|null and adds an explicit return null.
