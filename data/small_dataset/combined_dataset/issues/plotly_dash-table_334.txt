Feature Request: Client-side cell formulating


It recently occurred to me that while you can accomplish a lot as a developer on the Python backend for cell computation in the Data-table, your user base may not be as capable. Thus I thought it would be a fascinating idea to implement client-side cell formulating much like excel. Thus as a developer, you feed users the data that would be hard to come by naturally and let them do with as they please with their basic knowledge of Excel and spreadsheet software.
I understand this would likely be a big undertaking. I picture a single option that enables this:
client_formulas=True
