[Form] add hidden field to form when CSRF is disabled


Description
Hi, sometimes you want to have a "dummy" or "empty" form just to force the HTML POST request, i.e.
class DeleteArticle extends AbstractType
{
}

This works perfectly with the CSRF turned on, as a hidden input field is added.
However, when for instance doing e2e testing, I found myself turning off the CSRF protection. This, however, breaks the empty form, as a form with no input is not a valid HTML form submission, therefore $form->isSubmitted() // => false;
What I ended up doing was sth like this:
if ($env !== 'prod') {
    $builder->add('make_form_submit', HiddenType::class)
}

I was wondering if this should not be the natural responsibility of the Form component - determine whether a form has any inputs at all, and if not, append a hidden field for the sole purpose of being able to submit the form.
Or would this not be desired? Does anyone actually take advantage of the fact that inputless forms cannot be submitted? I have always regarded it as an HTML bug/sth to normalize, rather than a useful feature.
Thanks for your answers :)
