Activity feed granular permissions


The activity feed doesn't seem to respect permissions. With a restricted user with only the Employee role, and the Employee role with Rules to access only the Employee's own data and salary slips I can still see Activity feed entries that leak data about Communications, as well as Submission and Deletion entries on other Employee's salary slips.
More over I can see login and logout information about all users.
How are permissions on the activity feed managed currently and could they be more granular?
