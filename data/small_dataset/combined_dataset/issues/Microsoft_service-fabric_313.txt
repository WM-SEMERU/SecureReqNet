Backup/Restore service not coming up with Standalone cluster with GMSA security.


Hi #raunakpandya , #aagup
I still have a problem with the FabricBRSSetup.exe file in the latest release (6.4.644.9590) when activating the backup/restore service.
When activating on a node, this file crashes on the servers, with a null exception error in main. However, if I swap the faulting file on the node with an older version (e.g from 6.3.187.9494) it will start up the service and activate on the node.
This was a short term fix though, as when a node is restarted at a later point in time, the cluster replaces the FAbricBRSSetup.exe with the latest version and the error starts again.
So there is an issue with this file, primarily around the GMSA code. I decompiled the EXE and found some differences, and potentially missing try/catch sections where new code was added between versions.
This was the old thread on this issue:
#267 (comment)
The file FabricBRSSetup.exe errors with this event log entry:
Application: FabricBRSSetup.exe
Framework Version: v4.0.30319
Description: The process was terminated due to an unhandled exception.
Exception Info: System.NullReferenceException
   at System.Fabric.BackupRestore.Setup.Program.Main(System.String[])

I am currently having to re-create the cluster to remove backup/restore, until this can be resolved.
Thank you,
Darran
