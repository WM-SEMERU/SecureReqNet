Typing Too Fast Too Soon In Location Bar Problem


Description
When I open a new tab and immediately start typing, the first few characters are removed once the URL history is loaded in the location bar.
Steps to Reproduce

Visit a site like gmail.com so that it is in your history
Open a new tab via CMD-T
Immediately start typing out gmail.com

Actual result:
Instead of having exactly what I typed (e.g., gmail.com) remain in the location bar upon opening a new tab, the first several characters are removed once the URL history is loaded.
Expected result:
I would expect that as soon as I can start typing into the location bar, that it will remain there after everything has loaded.
Reproduces how often:
I can reproduce this every time if I am quick enough with my typing.
