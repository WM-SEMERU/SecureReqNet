Proposals to make the anonymous security config simpler


Description
After having delivered some introductory Symfony workshops lately, I'd like to propose some changes to make anonymous-related security config easier to explain/understand.
Example
My first petition is a DX-related change. The IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY "role" is always strange for newcomers. It's not a role, but we use it in the roles option ... and its name is too long and easy to mistype:
Before:
security:
    access_control:
        - { path: "^/something/login", roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
After:
security:
    access_control:
        - { path: "^/something/login", anonymous: true }
By the way, the Spring security system we took inspiration from, use allow to use ROLE_ANONYMOUS in addition to IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY. So maybe this can be enough:
security:
    access_control:
        - { path: "^/something/login", roles: ROLE_ANONYMOUS }

My second petition is about the anonymous setting in the firewall. It's always confusing to understand ... and it's not documented in the Symfony Security Config Reference.
As soon as some access_control URL allows to access anonymous users, you must set it to anonymous: ~. What's the point of not adding it? Users won't be able to access to the login form and nothing will work. Can we remove this option or make it smarter and auto-detect when you need to allow anonymous users for some URLs?
Thanks!
