service names not translated when sent to amplitude for several services


I know this is a bug for cloudops-deployment, but wanted to capture this in a public place since the events are amplitude emit from here.
Running this query in BigQuery:
SELECT
  jsonPayload.fields.event_properties as ep
FROM
  `moz-fx-fxa-prod-0712.fxa_prod_logs.docker_fxa_auth_20190327`
WHERE jsonPayload.fields.event_type = 'fxa_activity - cert_signed'
AND jsonPayload.fields.event_properties LIKE "%undefined_oauth%"
GROUP BY ep
ORDER BY ep
LIMIT
  10
Results in:

1 | {"service":"undefined_oauth","oauth_client_id":"20f7931c9054d833"} |  
-- | -- | --
2 | {"service":"undefined_oauth","oauth_client_id":"3c49430b43dfba77"} |  
3 | {"service":"undefined_oauth","oauth_client_id":"9dbca21ec249771d"} |  
4 | {"service":"undefined_oauth","oauth_client_id":"a2270f727f45f648"} |  
5 | {"service":"undefined_oauth","oauth_client_id":"e7ce535d93522896"} |  

20f7931c9054d833 is Firefox Send for Android

a2270f727f45f648 is Fenix

This will make it difficult to segment those services on amplitude except by client_id
