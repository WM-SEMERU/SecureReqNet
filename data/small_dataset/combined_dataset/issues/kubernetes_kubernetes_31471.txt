[AppArmor] Promote AppArmor annotations to beta


Justification for promoting AppArmor to beta:

We will provide an upgrade path to GA
We don't anticipate any major changes to the design, and will continue to invest in this feature
We will thoroughly test it. If any serious issues are uncovered we can reevaluate, and we're committed to fixing them.
We plan to provide beta-level support for the feature anyway (responding quickly to issues).

Note that this does not include the yet-to-be-merged status annotation (#31382). I'd like to propose keeping that one alpha for now because I'm not sure the PodStatus is the right long-term home for it (I think a separate monitoring channel, e.g. cAdvisor, would be a better solution).
