There are two references for a milestone in an issue. In the picture below the green one points to the correct link, the red one is wrong.

![milestone_bug](https://gitlab.com/uploads/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/c98a75fbd2/milestone_bug.png)

## Reproduce it

1. Go to my test repo https://gitlab.com/axil/playground/issues
2. Go to issue 1 and see that the milestone is correctly set.
3. Go to issue 2 which has the same milestone as issue 1, the milestone link is wrong.
4. Milestone link for issue 3 is wrong as well.
