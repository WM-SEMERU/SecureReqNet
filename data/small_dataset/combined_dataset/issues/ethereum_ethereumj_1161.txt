Unsafe Java object serialization


What's wrong
Ethash class uses pure Java object serialization to store light and full datasets.
As @ThingToNO pointed out, this serialization in its pure form can be exploited, additional information can be found here.
However, in this particular case it doesn't look valuable for attacker.
How to fix
Looks like the easiest way is to use custom serialization.
