fix(DomRegistry): add missing elements


fixes #11219

The first commit improves readability - important for security sensitive code,
The code commit add 4 missing tags (data, menuitem, summary, tags)

@mhevery @mprobst @rjamet Could you please double check the security impact ?
Might be nice to have in Angular2 final (it was detected the day RC6 was announced, some devs out there probably use some of those tags)
/cc @laco0416 Thanks for the initial report !
