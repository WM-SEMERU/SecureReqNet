DNS resolution fails if no newline at the end of resolv.conf


by bortzmeyer:
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. http.Get(anyurl) (or anything which uses Dial)
2. compile
3. run

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect a nil error

But I get:

Error Get http://data.keolis-rennes.com/xml/: dial tcp
data.keolis-rennes.com:http: lookup data.keolis-rennes.com.: no DNS servers


What is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?

GOOS=linux
GOARCH=386
GOROOT=/local/go

Please provide any additional information below.

All the other programs (dig, ping, wget) work fine with this
resolv.conf.But Go, instead of using the OS routines, implements its own
name resolution logic which fails if the /etc/resolv.conf does not have a
new line at the end. 

If I add a new line to resolv.conf, it is OK again.
