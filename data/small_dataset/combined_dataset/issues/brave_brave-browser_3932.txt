python-patch repo has moved


I noticed that we use an obsolete repository for src/brave/vendor/python-patch/:
https://github.com/svn2github/python-patch
The upstream repo has moved to: https://github.com/techtonik/python-patch
We're also using version 1.14dev (from 2014)  whereas the latest version is 1.16 (from 2016).
There aren't a lot of changes we're likely to be interested in, but these ones stand out:

Python 3 support, thanks to Yen Chi Hsuan (@yan12125) (pull request techtonik/python-patch#36)
support for broken patches generated by online Google Code editor
improved Git patch detection thanks to @mspncp (techtonik/python-patch#32)
