UUID for a cluster


Generate a UUID when you kube-up.sh a cluster.
One use case is for associating credentials with multiple clusters.

.kubernetes_auth format could have sections for each cluster UUID.  So, if you start an e2e cluster it won't clobber your creds for your dev cluster.  A flag to kubectl could let you set what UUID you are talking to.

e.g.:  {"UUID": "123-...", "BearerToken": "abc"}\n { "UUID": "456-...", "User": "foo", "Password":"bar"}


more generally, if you have clusters in several regions.  You don't want to identify by master IP since that might change.  And you don't want to rely on DNS because you don't always have a DNS mapping from cluster-name to master IPs.
when we want to name resources that are unique to a cluster using an URL that is portable across clusters.

E.g:  kubernetes:123-456-789-234234-567567/api/v1beta1/ns/mynamespace/pods/mypodname



Garbage collection of old UUIDs in the .kubernetes_auth is left as an exercise to the user.
