New HTTP package has no XSRF support


The new common/http package does not support XSRF out of the box.
Current behavior
Doesn't handle XSRF out of the box :-(
Expected behavior
Like the previous package - when the server sets a cookie called XSRF-TOKEN, the client should send back an X-XSRF-TOKEN header with its value on every request.
