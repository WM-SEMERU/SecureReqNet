If there are existing Merge Requests still pending when the Merge Request feature if turned off for a project, those MR will still show up in reports like https://gitlab/groups/groupname/merge_requests?project_id=&scope=all&state=opened

When you click the link they will 404. The MR should either get closed automatically (not desirable) or be filtered from these views (better).
