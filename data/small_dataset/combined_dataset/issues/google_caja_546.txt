Document that number-ish property names are unprotected


Original issue 546 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-12T17:07:40.000Z:
If typeof n === number, then many things will allow unrestricted ability to
read/write o[n].  Note that this is true even if n is 5.7, or Nan, or
Infinity, in which case this allows you to set o["Nan"] or o["Infinity"]
even if those aren't whitelisted.  Consequence: These property names cannot
be made non-public members.
MarkM tried to explain to me the invariant: something like if
x === String(Number(x))
then x is a number-ish string, and all property names that qualify
number-ish strings are unprotected -- or something, but I'm sure I've
forgotten.
