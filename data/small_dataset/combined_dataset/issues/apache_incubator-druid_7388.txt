Support LPAD and RPAD sql function


LPAD and RPAD are sql functions supported by oracle and hive etc. This PR tries to add them in druid.
The syntax is LPAD(base, len, pad).
It adds padding characters to the left or right side of a base string up to a given length. The default padding character is a space. If the string's length is greater than the required length, it will be trimmed (excess characters will be removed).
