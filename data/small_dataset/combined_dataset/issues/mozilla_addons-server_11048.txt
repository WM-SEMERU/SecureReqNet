Add CORS headers to `validation.json` URLs


The code-manager client fetches the linter data using the validation.json endpoints:
https://addons-dev.allizom.org/en-US/developers/addon/androidadbplus2/file/252861/validation.json

Because we are not on the same domain (code.a.m.o vs a.m.o) and CORS are not configured, we cannot retrieve the data in -dev (and therefore stage and prod). We don't have this problem in local dev because we're using an insecure proxy.
