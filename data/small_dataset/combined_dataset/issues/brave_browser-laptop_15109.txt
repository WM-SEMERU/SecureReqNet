I fired it up to see if the 'always launches on monitor 3 instead of whatever monitor it was last closed on' bug was fixed (#14901).  It wasnt.  Then I discovered that lastpass needed me to authenticate (i use 2 factor with a yubikey).  When i tried it wouldnt connect.  Lastpass gives this message:
An error occurred while attempting to contact the server. Please check your Internet connection.
This happens WHILE im streaming a video from the Internet, so I'm pretty sure the connection is okay.
While typing this i just noticed that the lastpass icon was red.  Okay... does it work now?  If I click on the icon, the menu pops up and the icon turns yellow.  If I click on the yellow icon, I get the above error message and then it turns red again.  I go to a page that requires me to login to test lastpass and I see that it does fill in the password.  So it kind of works, but is very quirky.
