Consider whether we should add deprecated ciphers to our list of accepted ciphers


AFAIK we currently only have ciphers considered modern in net::connector::DEFAULT_CIPHERS, so no response ever have their HTTPS state to HttpsState::Deprecated. More importantly, that also probably means we only support sites that could get a green padlock in Firefox.
