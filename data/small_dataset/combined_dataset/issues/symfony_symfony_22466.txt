Alias of security.user_checker to Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserCheckerInterface seems missing.
Defining an autowired service that depends on the interface raises a deprecation error (Autowiring services based on the types they implement is deprecated since Symfony 3.3 and won't be supported in version 4.0. You should rename (or alias) the "security.user_checker" service to "Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserCheckerInterface")
