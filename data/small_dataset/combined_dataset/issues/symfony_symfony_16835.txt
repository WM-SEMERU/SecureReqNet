[Security] Add Guard authenticator <supports> method


This method will be called before starting an authentication against a guard authenticator.
The authentication will be tried only if the supports method returned true
This improves understanding of code, increase consistency and removes responsability for getCredentials method to decide if the current request should be supported or not.
