What happens when user object is serialized, unserialized and implements EquatableInterface needs clarification or a rewrite.

I think that "bug" is really a documentation issue. People read the documentation and expect to be redirected to the login page if isEqualTo() returns false.  If I understand correctly, what really happens is that the authentication token is invalidated but you are not logged out as the docs suggest. A new token is created the next time AuthorizationCheckerInterface::isGranted() is called.
It's a confusing subject. I could have a go at rewriting it but I think it would be best to come from someone with a deep understanding of Symfony security.
