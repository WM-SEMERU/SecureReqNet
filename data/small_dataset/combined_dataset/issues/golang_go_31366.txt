What did you do?
Attempt to download the latest version of the AWS Go SDK, inadvertently mistyping the name
go get github.com/aws/aws-go-sdk@latest

The actual repository path is https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go, so the command failing is correct behavior.
What did you expect to see?
As error message stating that the import path github.com/aws/aws-go-sdk is invalid.
What did you see instead?
An error message about not being able to read "Username" and a link to information about private repositories
go get github.com/aws/aws-go-sdk@latest: git ls-remote -q https://github.com/aws/aws-go-sdk in /home/codewilling/dylan.bourque/dev/golang/pkg/mod/cache/vcs/d17433d3d37a4277c59cbf405fe09ca63188d440a697cdf310f37325d812006f: exit status 128:
