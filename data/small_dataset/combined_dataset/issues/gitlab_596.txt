I've shared dotfiles with a coworker and he happened to forget to edit my value of `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`. So his commits appeared as mine, although he used his own SSH key properly linked to his Gitlab account.

I assume it should not be like that. While git allows me to set a username and address as needed, wouldn't it be wise to check that value while committing?
