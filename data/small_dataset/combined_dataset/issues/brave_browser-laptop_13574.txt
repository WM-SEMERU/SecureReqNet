changing plugin settings should probably prompt for restart


toggling about:preferences#plugins switches may require restart to work
i tested this with widevine (turning it on, then off again). it appears to not actually be turned off until the browser is restarted.
IIRC flash used to require this too, so this may be a regression
test plan:

go to about preferences with widevine enabled
click 'plugins' tab
disabling widevine should require restart
