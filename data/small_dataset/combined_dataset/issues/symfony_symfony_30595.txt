If a form has Valid constraint and validation_groups set to an empty array (to disable validation) then its children were still validated using default validation group because FormValidator validated the form data using the empty array validation group here
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Validator/Constraints/FormValidator.php#L76
and then RecursiveContextualValidator treats the empty array as default validation group here.
