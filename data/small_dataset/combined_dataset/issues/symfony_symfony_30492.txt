[DependencyInjection] Cannot set a service to public through autoconfigure unless _defaults are set


Symfony version(s) affected

v4.2.3.2
v4.1.9.1
v4.0.7
v3.4.7
v3.3.9


Affected versions of symfony/skeleton (basically all of them) rather than symfony/dependency-injection - have not tested individual versions of the Dependency Injection component.

Probably not noticed in previous versions because public: false was in _defaults when creating a project from certain versions.
Description
When autoconfiguring a service via the interface it implements, the visibility (public true/false) cannot be changed unless services._defaults.public: false has been set.
How to reproduce

Create a project from the latest version of symfony/skeleton (zanbaldwin/symfony@ae5de65). Current version is v4.2.3.2 at the time of this issue.
Setup container configuration (zanbaldwin/symfony@2cfe163).

Create App\MyInterface.
Create App\MyService which implements App\MyInterface.
Autoconfigure the interface in App\Kernel::build() with $container->registerForAutoconfiguration(MyInterface::class)->setPublic(true);


View service using bin/console debug:container MyService and note that Public is set to no.

However:

Modify config/services.yaml and add a default value of public (zanbaldwin/symfony@76ec173):
services:
    _defaults:
        public: false

Rerun command bin/console debug:container MyService to see that Public is now set to yes.

Additional context
See branch zanbaldwin/symfony@bug/service-visibility-autoconfigure for bug reproduced in minimal amount of steps (2 commits not including installing Symfony).
