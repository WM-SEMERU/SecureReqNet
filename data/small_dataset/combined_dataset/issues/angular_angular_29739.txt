ngClass from component method restores original classes


🐞 bug report
Description
I'm using Bootstrap tabs and ngClass to append additional classes. I found that when using a component method for ngClass that it seems the original classes are getting restored when a component within the tab container changes.
This does not happen when using an object directly within ngClass or by using [class.] syntax.
🔬 Minimal Reproduction
https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-bypyy7
Notice that the 'active' class gets restored in the first example in the project, but not the others.
