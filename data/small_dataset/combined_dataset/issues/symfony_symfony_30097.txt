When using ServiceSubscriberInterface with aliased services, if you want your services to be available as an alias or with it's fully qualified name, you have to add multiple line.
This PR aims to avoid that by automatically adding needed service name using the following rules:

If the service is an alias, add only the aliased service
If the service is parent service, add all of its aliases, if any.

This PR will only do it for indexes with no key.
When devs specifically indicates local alias and original service ID, I think they know what they're doing and we do not have to add others alias for them.
BEFORE :
public static function getSubscribedServices()
{
    return [
        'some.service' => 'stdClass',
        'stdClass' => 'stdClass',
    ];
}
AFTER :
public static function getSubscribedServices()
{
    return [
        'some.service',
    ];
}
OR:
public static function getSubscribedServices()
{
    return [
        'stdCladd',
    ];
}
Note that the first code will still work as excpted.
