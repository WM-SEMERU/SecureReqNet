Create authentication proxy for grafana that uses the same security plugins


Grafana has an AuthProxy setting that allows an application running on a trusted IP to provide authentication and then relay the username in an Http header.  This will allow a new grafana-auth application to accepy x509 certificates, authenticate, check access, and then relay the username to grafana which will auto-create and login the provided user.
This along with Grafana's new permission model will allow dashboards to be maintained by admins and viewed by viewers while using the same user authentication as Timely.
The initial implementation will be for x509.  Using the /login and cookie methods will require some more work if that feature is wanted.
