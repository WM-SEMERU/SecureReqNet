No cipher preferences in generated keys; defaults to 3DES

Is this report about the crypto library or the extension?

What is the security bug?
With no explicit cipher preferences, GPG defaults to 3DES, which is not ideal. The fix is to include a signature subpacket listing the AES's as preferred ciphers.
Here is my key generated with the Google E2E extension (and reexported from GPG v2.1). If you import it and run gpg --edit-key on it, you'll see these preferences:
gpg> showpref
 unknown. themax@gmail.com
Cipher: 3DES
Digest: SHA1
Compression: ZIP, Uncompressed
While you're at it, you should include preferred hash algorithms.

How would someone exploit it?
No known exploit, but 3DES is considered pretty weak these days and most people don't use it.
