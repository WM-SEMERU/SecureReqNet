Not sure if this is a bug or feature request, but i think it should have high priority (since Gitlab is leaving Github for main project hosting).

It is not possible to mention people (with autocomplete) that are not part of the Gitlab project. But since this is a public project, I think i should be able to at least mention people that are already participating in a discussion.

If you need more information about what I mean, please let me know :smile:
