[DependencyInjection] Add a "list" EnvProcessor


Description
Errors excepted, I did not see an EnvProcessor to convert a comma-separated list as an array.
Example
The following configuration :
services:
  App\MyNamepsace\MyService:
    $arguments : 
        $myarray: %env(list:val1,val2,val3)%
should be inject as an array
class MyService {
  public function __contruct(array $myarray) {
    ...
  }
}
where $myarray = ["val1","val2","val3"]
Question/Suggestion
It should be better to control the separation character, but I don't see how to do that
