After upgrading to Gitlab 6.7 I am getting an "Access denied for your LDAP account.". I do know if it is connecting because if I try the wrong password I get an invalid credentials response. The unicorn log only shows: "I, [2014-03-21T10:27:37.303549 #7237]  INFO -- omniauth: (ldap) Callback phase initiated."

This shows in the production log:
