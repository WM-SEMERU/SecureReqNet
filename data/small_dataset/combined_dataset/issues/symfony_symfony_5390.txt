User switching not possible with any TokenInterface implementation other than UsernamePasswordToken


Would it not be a good idea to make the SwitchUserListener agnostic of what token class is being used?
Sure, you can override the SwitchUserListener with your own listener class, but to do that properly you would have to have more than a basic understanding of Symfony's security internals...
