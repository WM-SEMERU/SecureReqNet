As test.client is not shared anyway, I think it would be better to create a new client directly instead of having it in the container.
The only use cases for having a service in the container are:


If you want to override some class names, but you can then be more explicit and override the WebTestCase::createClient() method


If you want to inject some specific server parameters (but you can already do that when calling createClient())


WDYT?
