User can create a key without a passphrase

Is this report about the crypto library or the extension?
extension
What is the security bug?
The user can create a key pair which is directly saved unencrypted to the local storage. In a second action the key can be secured with a passphrase.
How would someone exploit it?
After creating the kay pair, someone with access to the file system of the computer could access the local storage where the key is not secured with a passphrase.
On creation the user should be ask for a passphrase, so the key pair can be directly stored in the local storage secured with a passphrase. If the user doesn't want a passphrase a warning should be shown.
