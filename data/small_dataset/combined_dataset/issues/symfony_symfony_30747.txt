[RFC][Form] Data transformer as a service


I like to propose the idea of using a Form DataTransformerInterface as a service. This would ease a vendor to ship some (complex) data transformers and let the user decide to use it yes/no in some specific form type.
Before
$builder->get('some')->addModelTransformer(new Vendor\SomeTransformer(
  $all, $the, $deps, $needed, $here
));
After
$builder->add('some', SomeType::class, ['model_transformers' => [
  'vendor.some_transformer',
  ClassNamedService::class,
  new MyTransformer(),
]]);
conceptually it applies to view transformers & event listeners as well.
