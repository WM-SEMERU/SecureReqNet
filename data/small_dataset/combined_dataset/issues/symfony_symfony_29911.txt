It seems that the bugfix made in #29307 seems to break quite some applications. I therefore suggest that we solve the issue a bit different by introducing a new accept_multiple_values option. This value will be null by default which means no checks will be performed for backwards compatibility. The core form types do explicitly set this value to false if they expect the submitted data to be strings. If a form is compound, the option value will automatically default to true.
Since from my experience most custom form types have child forms, they are already compound and so do accept arrays. Nothing will change for them. Other custom types will not have the check as long as they do not extend one of the built-in types that have this check enabled.
In Symfony 4.3 we can then deprecate the null default value so that each type must opt for either true or false as the value in 5.0.
