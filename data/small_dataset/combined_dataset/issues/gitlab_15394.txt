When we create usernames we escape the HTML because there isn't a situation where one is supposed to render the HTML of a username. 

There are not any situations where we want to render the actual label titles or the milestone titles as HTML. If someone named a label 

```
The <b>BESTEST</b> label
```

We wouldn't that to be rendered as 

> The **BESTEST** label

anywhere. 

I am 99% sure we don't want the labels and milestone descriptions rendered as HTML. If they are supposed to be HTML why not use markdown. Which also allows HTML. 

It seems inconsistent to allow limited HTML in some places and markdown in others.
