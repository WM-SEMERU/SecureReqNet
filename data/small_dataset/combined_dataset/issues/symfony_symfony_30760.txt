Now that event's FQDN could be used a eventName, this PR adds an alternative to EventSubscriberInterface that uses method's typehint to guess the event to subscribe.
usage for developers:
class MyListener implements EventListenerInterface {
  public function __invoke(MyEvent $e) {
  }
}

That's is. No more services to configure nor getSubscribedEvents to implement.
This PR contains 2 parts:

extends the tag kernel.event_listener to automatically register available methods when the tag does not contains the required name attribute.
add a new EventListenerInterface (which is empty) that's just use to trigger the registerForAutoconfiguration.

Few questionable choices made on that PR.

reuse the tag kernel.event_listener instead of creating a new one
priority is not configurable: EventSubscriberInterface is here for that

Fixed 2 issues:

tag container.hot_path was harcoded in subscriber logic (instead of using the injected variable)
dynamic registration of onMyEventName when event name is a FQDN className
