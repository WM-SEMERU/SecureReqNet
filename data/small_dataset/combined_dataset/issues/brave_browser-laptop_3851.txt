urlbar location may be incorrect when load fails


reported by eric lawrence:

Steps to reproduce:

open any site, ex: bankofamerica.com, in a tab
put http://bayden.com/test/redir/goscript.aspx in the urlbar and hit enter


Expected behavior
the page doesn't load, so the urlbar should still say bankofamerica.com
Actual behavior
the urlbar says http://bayden.com/test/redir/goscript.aspx
