# Description 

We'd like to add additional security not only to the UI but also to git operations in particular `git push`. 

# Examples

- Linux kernel hard tokens https://www.linux.com/blog/linux-kernel-git-repositories-add-2-factor-authentication  
- Soft tokens with gitolite https://github.com/mricon/totp-cgi/tree/master/contrib/gitolite  

*** 

Thoughts appreciated @stanhu @twk3
