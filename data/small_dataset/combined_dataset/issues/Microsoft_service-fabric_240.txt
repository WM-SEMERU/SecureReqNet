Can't seem to update Service Fabric settings


Get-ItemPropertyValue 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Service Fabric' -Name FabricVersion
6.3.187.9494
I have been trying to update our cluster configuration by using
Get-ServiceFabricClusterConfiguration | Out-File c:\temp\sfconfig.json
Adding the new setting to this file
{ "Properties": { .... "FabricSettings": [ .... { "name": "MetricBalancingThresholds", "parameters": [ { "name": "CPU", "value": "1000" } ] } ] ..... }
Then trying to upload the modified file with the following command.
Start-ServiceFabricClusterConfigurationUpgrade -ClusterConfigPath C:\Temp\sfconfig.json
This results in the following error:
ValidationException: The new certificate cannot be added since the authentication type of the cluster cannot be modified.
I have not changed any of the authentication settings for the cluster, we are trying to upload exactly what was pulled down with the Get command.
So I tried removing the CertificateInformation section from the modified config, but this then results in an aggregateException containing the following:
"ErrorCode":  -2147017627,
"Message":  "Exception from HRESULT: 0x80071C65",
"Data":  "System.Collections.ListDictionaryInternal",
"InnerException":  null,
"TargetSite":  "Void EndUpgradeConfiguration(IFabricAsyncOperationContext)",
"StackTrace":  "   at System.Fabric.Interop.NativeClient.IFabricClusterManagementClient10.EndUpgradeConfiguration(IFabricAsyncOperationContext context)\r\n   at System.Fabric.Interop.Utility.\u003c\u003ec__DisplayClass22_0.\u003cWrapNativeAsyncInvoke\u003eb__0(IFabricAsyncOperationContext context)\r\n   at System.Fabric.Interop.AsyncCallOutAdapter2`1.Finish(IFabricAsyncOperationContext context, Boolean expectedCompletedSynchronously)",
"HelpLink":  null,
"Source":  "System.Fabric",
"HResult":  -2147017627
Which seems pretty unhelpful.
So what am I missing here, is there no way to upgrade our cluster configuration or am I doing something wrong?
