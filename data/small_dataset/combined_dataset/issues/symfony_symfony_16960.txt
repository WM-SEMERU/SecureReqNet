[SecurityBundle] Renaming the firewall context option


On IRC I often tend to help out with Security component/bundle related questions. Recently I had a question regarding the firewall context and sharing it between different firewalls. I thought: "What is a firewall context"? I obviously know the answer, but to someone new, it might not seem so obvious. The answer is simple:

It's the identifier for a given Token and the context option defines which token identifier the firewall should use.

So I thought back of 2.5 and lower, where we still had the SecurityContext. It was literally the context with your token in it, referring back to the context option underneath the firewall, which has the firewall name if not defined by the developer.  Now that the SecurityContext is gone, the option makes a lot less sense being named "context" as it lost all its references.
_My proposal is to rename this option to something different to make it easier for (new) developers._
Just to throw in a few ideas:

token-identifier
token-storage
storage-key
