CouchDB heavy storage consumption


We have a project that involved with a database sync with pouchdb in mobile devices. We have faced issue when updating multiple documents (8400 docs per minute), internal storage increasing (around 20MB per minute) frequency.
We figured one main reason for that couchdb revisions. So we decided to decrease database rev_limit to around 5. But we heard it may impact replication process between couchdb and pouchdb. So how this decrease of revision limit impact to the replication process?
And figured out views taking more space than normal document storage. Is there any way to reduce couchdb view size?
I have refered to this problem also and found out we don't have local documents issue
