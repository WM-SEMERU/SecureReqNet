Insufficient Entropy
Versions of cryptiles from version 3.1.0 through 3.1.2, and versions 4.0.0 to version 4.1.1 are vulnerable to insufficient entropy.  The randomDigits method generates digits that lack a perfect distribution over enough attempts.
Affected versions: >=3.1.0 <3.1.3; >=4.0.0 <4.1.2
