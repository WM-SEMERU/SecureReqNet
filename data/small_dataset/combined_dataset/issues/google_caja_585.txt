charset attribute is whitelisted


Original issue 585 created by tyler.close on 2008-06-13T00:55:55.000Z:
The charset attribute is whitelisted and is valid for the A element. Only
bad things can come of this. I don't know if browsers actually use this
attribute, but we shouldn't give 'em the opportunity.
