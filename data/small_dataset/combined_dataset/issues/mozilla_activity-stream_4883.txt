Bug 1541359 - Chore: Increase our frontend code coverage


After:

Added unit tests to bump our coverage to where the report is mostly green/gray making it easier to spot issues when trying to land new code.
ASRouterAdmin has a threshold set to 0 so adding new code there won't require any tests (that's the only one showing up in red).
