SQL explain in web console


Fixes #7377

Imitating explain plan for query and parse the response into JSON in a dialog
It locates here:


There are 4 different situations:

error message if the query is invalid
A query and its signature if the query can be parsed

Two queries for semi-joined queries

Explanations which could not be parsed into JSON
