On this page, https://about.gitlab.com/security/ we describe GitLab corporation's security governance policy for passwords:

> Do application, system, and device passwords (including routers, firewalls, databases, and external social spaces) require passwords to have the following characteristics: 1. minimum length of 8 characters, 2. chosen from any acceptable character sets available on the target system, 3. includes at least one alphabetic and one numeric character.)
YES

Should GitLab _the product_ enforce those rules as well? Currently you can make a password with 8 `aaaaaaaa`.
