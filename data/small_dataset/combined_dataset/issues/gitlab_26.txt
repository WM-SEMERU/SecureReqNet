Hi,

after importing couple of git project from file system vi command:

bundle exec rake gitlab:import:repos RAILS_ENV=production

I am given in some repos (I did not figure out the schema):
"
500
We're sorry, but something went wrong.

We've been notified about this issue and we'll take a look at it shortly.
"
Some repos don't work, some work like a charm.
I have found problem with this in releases v6.4.3 and v6.5.1.

Version v6.3.1 work without any problems.
