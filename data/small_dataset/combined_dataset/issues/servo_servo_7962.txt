Harden against HTTP cookie-based attacks


This paper demonstrates several cookie-based attacks.  Servo (and all browsers) needs to implement the hardening described in the paper on page 719.  Specifically:


A browser MUST NOT accept a cookie presented
in an HTTP response with the secure flag set, nor
overwrite an unexpired secure cookie, except the
case in 5.
Cookies with the secure flag MUST be given
higher priority over non-secure cookies.
A browser MUST only send the highest priority
cookie for any cookie name.
In removing cookies due to a too-full cookie store,
the browser MUST NOT remove a secure cookie
when there are non-secure cookies that can be removed.
The browser MUST allow an HTTP connection
to clear a secure cookie by setting an alreadyexpired
expiration date, but the browser MUST
NOT remove the cookie from the store. Instead,
the browser MUST set the “do not send” flag and
maintain the original expiration date.
The browser MUST NOT send a cookie with the
“do not send” flag, nor send any non-secure cookie
with the same name.
When issuing a request, the browser MUST rank the
cookie list by a) presence of the secure flag, and b)
specificity of the domain scope.
