Potential bug (or documentation mistake) in static file middleware (in returned headers)


I am reading code in static file middleware and i found this in method ApplyResponseHeaders:
if (statusCode == Constants.Status200Ok)
            {
                // this header is only returned here for 200
                // it already set to the returned range for 206
                // it is not returned for 304, 412, and 416
               _response.ContentLength = _length;

According to documentation I think, that header will not be setted for 206 statuscode.
