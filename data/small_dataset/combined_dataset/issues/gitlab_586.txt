We are doing some housekeeping in our tickets and noticed, that after editing closed ticket, which belongs to closed milestone, milestone will get removed from that ticket. 

There is a message about removing milestone in the ticket notes.

Expected behaviour: 

Milestone remains even if it was closed.
