[Security] Session target_path not set when the incoming request has no session


Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\ExceptionListener only sets the target path when $request->hasSession() is true. This is the wrong behavior IMO as it checks if there is a previous session instead of checking if the session is activated in the project (which would be done by checking null !== $request->getSession().
I open the issue as @schmittjoh asked it on IRC saying he needs to check further about this.
