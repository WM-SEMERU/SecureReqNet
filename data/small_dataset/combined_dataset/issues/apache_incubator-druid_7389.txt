Popovers are no longer inline


Figured out the container CSS needed to make the portals work and was able to make the Popovers (and dialogs) use portals instead of being inline.
Why is this important? Well check this out:

Notice how the backdrop in the "before" image only covers the header. This is an annoying visual artifact. Using a portal instead of declaring inline magically fixes it.
Also made misc usability fixes like having the spec dialog not start empty.
