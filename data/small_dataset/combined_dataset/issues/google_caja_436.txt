Cajoled module can call window.onerror


Original issue 436 created by collin.jackson on 2008-06-09T22:19:36.000Z:
What steps will reproduce the problem?
throw 42;
// this also works:
throw { toString: function() { return "42"; } };
What is the expected output?
Caja catches the exception and passes it off to some container-specific
error handler, if there is one.
What do you see instead?
The window.onerror handler is called with the argument "uncaught
exception: 42"
What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Caja Test Bed
Please provide any additional information below.
I don't have any specific attacks based on the current behavior, but there
doesn't seem to be a built-in way for the onerror handler to determine
where the uncaught exception came from, and it's potentially leaking
information out of the Caja module without going through the approved
channels.
