[Var-Dumper] Automatically prepend file and line number in CliDumper


Description
During few days, i had to use the dump() function in order to debug failing unit test.
In order to see where i placed dumps (and don't forget to remove them after the fix) i used to add the following argument to my dumps dump(__FILE__.' l.'.__LINE__, $myVar).
** Possible solution **
I made a POC which uses the debug_backtrace to get file and line and add those attributes to style which has effect to add a href in the console to the file. Ideally the final version would add a line like using dump(__FILE__.' l.'.__LINE__, $myVar) with this href.
Example

WDYT ?
