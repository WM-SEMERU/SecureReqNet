Machine should not use 'unsafe' characters in Openstack keypair


When executing docker-machine create using the openstack driver, machine will attempt to create a keypair with a name that uses the machine name concatenated with what appears to be a UUID/GUID.
For example, creating a machine test.example.org will result in the key name being:
test.example.org--60bbb7c7c0a8...
Unfortunately, it seems that Openstack does not consider periods to be valid ('unsafe') for the keypair name:
Error creating machine: Error in driver during machine creation: 
Expected HTTP response code [200] when accessing [POST https://my.openstack.endpoint.com], but got 400 instead
{"badRequest": {"message": "Keypair data is invalid: Keypair name contains unsafe characters", "code": 400}}

Reviewing the nova codebase, only underscores, hyphens, and alphanumeric characters are allowed for keypair names:
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/c44f711a0494db40ebbdacf85bfc3e7e2a357bf8/nova/compute/api.py#L3734
    def _validate_new_key_pair(self, context, user_id, key_name, key_type):
        safe_chars = "_- " + string.digits + string.ascii_letters
        clean_value = "".join(x for x in key_name if x in safe_chars)
        if clean_value != key_name:
            raise exception.InvalidKeypair(
                reason=_("Keypair name contains unsafe characters"))
A possible solution for this would be to replace these spooky, unsafe characters with either a hyphen or an underscore, ex:
test_example_org--60bbb7c7c0a8...
