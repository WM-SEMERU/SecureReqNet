Check that we are not using features deprecated in PHPUnit 8


Description
PHPUnit 8 has just been released. In addition to new features, the following has been deprecated and will be removed in PHPUnit 9:

assertInternalType() and assertNotInternalType()
assertArraySubset()
Annotation(s) for expecting exceptions
Assertions (and helper methods) that operate on (non-public) attributes
Optional parameters of assertEquals() and assertNotEquals()
TestListener interface
Optional parameters of assertContains() and assertNotContains() as well as using these methods with string haystacks

Full details at https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-8.html
Let's review our tests to make sure we don't use these. Thanks.
