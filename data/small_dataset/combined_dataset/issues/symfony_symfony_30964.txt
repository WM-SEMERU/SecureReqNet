This pull requests adds the first usage of array_key_first to the Symfony code base. Additionally, it makes it possible to configure the HttpCache to also add a "trace" header in production.
The HttpCache is a convenient, low-barrier yet performant way of accelerating the application. By having the "trace" information returned as a header in production as well, you can write it to server log files. For example, with Apache you can use %{X-Symfony-Cache}o in the LogFormat directive to log response headers.
With the information in the log files, you can easily process it from logfile processing/system metrics tools to find out about cache performance, efficiency and the URLs that might need extra cache tweaking.

The "short" format will only output information for the main request to avoid leaking internal URLs for ESI subrequests. I also chose a concise format like stale/valid/store because that's much easier to parse out of logfiles (no whitespace, no need for quotes etc.).
If you're not comfortable with having Symfony in the header name that way, the header name can be changed through a configuration setting as well.
