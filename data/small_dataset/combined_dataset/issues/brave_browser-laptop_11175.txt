Add alert for --no-sandbox [feature-request]


Refference Issue
#11134
Description
I was given no alert that brave was running with --no-sandbox.  I was just curious and stumbled across the running command looking at top.
Steps to Reproduce
$ brave --no-sandbox
Expected result:
I expected an alert that --no-sandbox is being used.
Google Chrome gives this alert when --no-sandbox is being used:
"You are using an unsupported command-line flag: --no-sandbox. Stability and security will suffer."
Maybe brave's alert could have a link to a webpage for more information.
