After upgrading to 6.5 it the web interface is displaying incorrectly. It almost seems like the CSS is broken or that it's trying to display a ultra-simplified version fo the interface.

I am also seeing a "Toggle Navigation" button now that I haven't seen before.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
