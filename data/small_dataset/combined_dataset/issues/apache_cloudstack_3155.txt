Provide mechanism to disable TLS versions/algorithms for CloudStack server services


In CloudStack secure socket-based services exists for agent server (port 8250) and jetty (8443/https). With recent limitation logged in #3140 a global fix is acceptable as a workaround however CloudStack needs to provide the mechanism (viz global settings or a commandline flag via the /etc/default/cloudstack-management) to disable TLS versions such as TLS v1.0, v1.1 etc.
