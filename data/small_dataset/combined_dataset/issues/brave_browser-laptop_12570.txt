#12577 (comment)

I'm using Brave 0.19.131 & checked the new security feature which is related to Spectre & Meltdown vulnerability. So, I tried using this http://xlab.tencent.com/special/spectre/spectre_check.html, it's saying it's vulnerable for Spectre. Check the Screenshot. I'm using macOS Sierra.
