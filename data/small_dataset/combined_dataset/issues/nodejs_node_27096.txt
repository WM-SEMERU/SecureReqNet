lib: use safe methods from primordials


This changes the primordials to expose built-in prototypes with their
methods already uncurried.
The uncurryThis function is therefore moved to the primordials.
All uses of uncurryThis on built-ins are changed to import the relevant
prototypes from primordials.
All uses of Function.call.bind are also changed to use primordials.
