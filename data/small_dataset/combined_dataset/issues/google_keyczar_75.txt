KeyczarTool private key export reveals passphrase


When exporting a private key as a PKCS8 file, the user has to specify the 
passphrase on the command line with --passphrase="my password".  This makes it 
possible for users of arcane hacking tools like "ps" to discover the 
passphrase.  Not good.

I had intended to use --passphrase as a boolean flag indicating "prompt me for 
a passphrase" and then to have KeyczarTool prompt twice, without echo, etc.  
But then I got busy and forgot.

Filing this bug to make sure I don't continue to forget.
