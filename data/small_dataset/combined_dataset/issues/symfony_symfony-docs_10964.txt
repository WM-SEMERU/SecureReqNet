Explain format of paths in security.access_control


The following pages explain how the firewall works:

https://symfony.com/doc/master/security/access_control.html
https://symfony.com/doc/master/security.html#securing-url-patterns-access-control
https://symfony.com/doc/master/best_practices/security.html

They never explain that we can use a regular expression.
For example, we use this configuration in on of our projects and it works:
- { path: ^/api/(entity1|entity2)/\d+$, methods: ['GET'], roles: ROLE_USER }

It matches /api/entity1/528491 and /api/entity2/528491.
I think that the documentation should explain that we can use regular expression in path.
