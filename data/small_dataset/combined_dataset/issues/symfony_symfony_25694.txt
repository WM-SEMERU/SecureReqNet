I've got an issue with the usage of the LogoutListener. I'm trying to add some customized handling, but got stopped by the requiresLogout() method. It's protected and the docblock reads:

The default implementation only processed requests to a specific path,
but a subclass could change this to logout requests where
certain parameters is present.

I've created a custom class extending the base one, but now I cannot access e.g. the TokenStorage, because it's a private property. I can copy&paste the required stuff, but that must be wrong.
Did I miss something how this should be done or should the private proprties be protected?
Cheers
Matthias
