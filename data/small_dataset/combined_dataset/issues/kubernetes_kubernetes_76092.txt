go modules: move Godeps/LICENSES to vendor/LICENSES


This is a follow-up from #74877
To scrub all references to Godeps, relocate Godeps/LICENSES to vendor/LICENSES

Update generation script (hack/update-vendor-licenses.sh)
Update verification script (hack/verify-vendor-licenses.sh)
Update build/packaging scripts to include the file from the new location (search for references to Godeps/LICENSES) and verify output packages/tars are identical

/sig release
/kind cleanup
