[Form] Import single block from a template?


I use different templates to override different widgets. For example, our customer wants read-only inputs to be displayed as text. To do this, I've created a form/disabled_as_text.html.twig file and registered it in my config under twig.form_themes.
The file should've looked something like this:
{% use 'bootstrap_4_layout.html.twig' %}

{%- block form_widget_simple -%}
    {% if disabled %}
        <div class="d-block">
            {{ value }}
        </div>
    {% else %}
        {{ parent() }}
    {% endif %}
{%- endblock -%}

The problem is that use imports ALL blocks from that template. When the form is rendered it goes through all the templates defined in twig.form_themes and calls the first one that contains the required block. Since form/disabled_as_text.html.twig includes all blocks from the base layout all the other form files will never be called.
A workaround would be to rename all the unneeded blocks using {% use '...' with block_name as _block_name %} but I hope it's obvious that this is not a viable solution.
Something like {% use '...' with block_name only %} is needed.
