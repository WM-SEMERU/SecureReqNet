Hello,

Could we be a bit more verbose with the hook that is posted when a merge request happens. For example, include the following:

 - Project name, url
 - Author username
 - Assignee username
 - Link to merge request

This would make building hooks a lot easier, and reduce the amount of extra API calls needed to do things.

Thanks, Scott
