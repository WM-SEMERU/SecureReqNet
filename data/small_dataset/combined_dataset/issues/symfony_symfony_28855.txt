Since version 3.0, AccessDecisionManager::decide can be called from inside a voter. When doing so, the result of decide from inside
the voter is displayed in the profiler at the same place as the results of the decisions called via isGranted. From my point of view, it's confusing.
Let's imagine we call isGranted once in a controller action. If one of the implicated voters calls AccessDecisionManager::decide, we'll have two decision results in the profiler. But only the last result is the decision for isGranted. The first result is only a part of this decision, with no more importance than any one of the implicated voters.
This PR allows to not display decision results which are called from inside a voter.
