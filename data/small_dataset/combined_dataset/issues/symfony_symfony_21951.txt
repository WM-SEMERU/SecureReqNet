Updated SwitchUserEvent to include the generated security Token. Allows the listeners to replace the token with their own (in case an application has some custom logic for token generation). The SwitchUserListener will now use the token returned by the event, so if token was not changed the self generated token will be used. If token was changed in the event then the new token would get used.
Reasons for this feature
In our current project users can have different Role sets depending on which organization they switch to. Our User->getRoles() always returns ["ROLE_USER"] and after login user is presented with choice of organizations they want to work in. Based on selected organization roles get updated with then stored token.
Without the change proposed in this PR. The only way we can setup the proper roles during user switch is by replacing security.authentication.switchuser_listener service with our own implementation of the listener.
With the proposed change, we can replace the security token with the one having all the roles we require directly inside our listener for security.switch_user event that gets thrown by Symfony's SwitchUserListener
