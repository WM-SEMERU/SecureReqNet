Init help suggests there are feature gates but lists none


Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?
BUG REPORT
Versions
kubeadm version: kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"13", GitVersion:"v1.13.4", GitCommit:"c27b913fddd1a6c480c229191a087698aa92f0b1", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-02-28T13:35:32Z", GoVersion:"go1.11.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
What happened?
kubeadm init --help has this section:
[...]
      --feature-gates string                 A set of key=value pairs that describe feature gates for various features. Options are:

  -h, --help                                 help for init
[...]

That is, it suggests there are feature gates, but then presents an empty list.
What you expected to happen?
Looking at the source, it appears there actually aren't any in the current version.
The flag should either be omitted completely, or (probably better) explain that there aren't any valid values. I should not have to check the source to understand why there are no options presented.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
kubeadm init --help
