Hi,
I have migrated my gitlab installation successfully, using the backup feature:
```
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
```

Everything works well, except one thing.

On my previous server, the ssh port was 122, on the new one it is 22. ```gitlab.yml``` is well configured.

However the project pages still display urls looking like: ```ssh://git@gitlab.mydomain.net:122/me/my-project.git``` where I'd like them to be ```ssh://git@gitlab.mydomain.net/me/my-project.git```

This makes me unable to use Gitlab CI too, as it tries to clone the git repository from the wrong port.
