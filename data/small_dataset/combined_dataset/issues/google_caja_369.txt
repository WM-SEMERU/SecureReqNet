Please review erights/unwhitelist-prototype


Original issue 369 created by erights on 2008-06-03T04:02:06.000Z:
caja.js was inappropriately whitelisting Function and
Function.prototype, causing bug 346. This CL removes that
whitelisting, repairs the one line of code that depended on it, and
tests that an attempt to access a function's prototype now fails.
