Fixes a little bug in *CompleteConfigurationTest: if a test fails for one format, subsequent tests for other formats will also fail. This is because subsequent tests actually use the container built from the very first tested config, which is PHP if all tests are ran.
This can be reproduced by changing a value in the PHP config fixtures. PhpCompleteConfigurationTest will fail as expected but XmlCompleteConfigurationTest and YamlCompleteConfigurationTest will fail too, which is not expected.
