Leakage of prototype - how a problem?


Original issue 78 created by ihab.awad on 2008-03-03T06:31:48.000Z:
ExpressionSanitizerTest contains the below test. What is the risk in
leaking an alias to the prototype of a class? The prototype is frozen as
soon as the class is used as a constructor, so the alias will point to a
frozen object, right? Am I missing something?
public void testAssignmentToPrototypeNoCheating() throws Exception {
runTest("x = MyClass.prototype = new MyOtherClass;",
"{\n"
+ "  _OUTERS.x = (function () {\n"
+ "      var x__ = _OUTERS.MyClass;\n"
+ "      var x0__ = new _OUTERS.MyOtherClass;\n"
// No return allowed here.
+ "      x__.prototype_canSet___"
+ " ? (x___.prototype = x0___)"
+ " : _.setPub(x, 'prototype', x0__);\n"
+ "    })();\n"
+ "}",
// Ok as long as the closure does not return a value.
true);
