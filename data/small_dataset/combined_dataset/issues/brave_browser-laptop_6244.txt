Yes.
Describe the issue you encountered:
This came in from community.brave.com https://community.brave.com/t/eff-panopticlick-and-brave/157 but apparently the EFF offers a cool online tool to check your browsers privacy and despite having fingerprint detection turned on and Do Not Track we are "failing" those checks on the EFF's site.
Expected behavior:
We should pass all tests with DNT and Fingerprint Detection turned on.


Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?):
macOS


Brave Version:
0.12.15


Steps to reproduce:

Open Brave
Turn on Shields > Fingerprint Protection
Go to Preferences > Security and turn on Do Not Track header
Go to https://panopticlick.eff.org/
