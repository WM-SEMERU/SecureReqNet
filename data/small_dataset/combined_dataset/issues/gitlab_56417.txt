'### Prior to the security release

- [ ] Read the [security process for developers] if you are not familiar with it.
- [ ] Link to the original issue adding it to the [links section](#links)
- [ ] Run `scripts/security-harness` in the CE, EE, and/or Omnibus to prevent pushing to any remote besides `dev.gitlab.org`
- [ ] Create an MR targetting `org` `master`, prefixing your branch with `security-`
- [ ] Label your MR with the ~security label, prefix the title with `WIP: [master]`
- [ ] Add a link to the MR to the [links section](#links)
- [ ] Add a link to an EE MR if required
- [ ] Make sure the MR remains in-progress and gets approved after the review cycle, **but never merged**.
- [ ] Add a link to this issue on the original security issue.

#### Backports

- [ ] Once the MR is ready to be merged, create MRs targetting the last 3 releases, plus the current RC if between the 7th and 22nd of the month.
    - [ ] At this point, it might be easy to squash the commits from the MR into one
    - You can use the script `bin/secpick` instead of the following steps, to help you cherry-picking. See the [secpick documentation]
    - [ ] Create the branch `security-X-Y` from `X-Y-stable` if it doesn't exist (and make sure it's up to date with stable)
    - [ ] Create each MR targetting the security branch `security-X-Y`
    - [ ] Add the ~security label and prefix with the version `WIP: [X.Y]` the title of the MR
- [ ] Add the ~"Merge into Security" label to all of the MRs.
- [ ] Make sure all MRs have a link in the [links section](#links)
