proposal: crypto/tls: add support for AES-CCM


Hi! I am working in a project that requires AES-CCM cipher suite within TLS. I know that crypto/tls aims to support a limited safe subset of TLS. But since TLS 1.3 will only support the following cipher suites:
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256
TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256
Reducing that list from 5 to only 3 choices seems pretty unfair.
I've seen some working golang AES-CCM implementations around github. Is there any specific reason why this cipher suite is not included?
Thanks!
Update:
Another option could be to port the code from BoringSSL: https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/crypto/cipher_extra/e_aesccm.c
