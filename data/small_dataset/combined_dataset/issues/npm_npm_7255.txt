Warn at install about PATH lookup issues in global installs


So, if you install a package that has a bin named something like "ruby" or "shutdown", it'll drop it by default into /usr/local/bin/..., which takes precedence on most unix systems over /usr/bin/....
npm is smart enough to not clobber a bin it doesn't own.  So that's good.  But still, it's confusing and weird, and can ruin someone's day.

If a bin is not going to be the thing found in the PATH, we should warn about that.  (The package isn't actually doing what it says, perhaps.)
If a bin is going to be found in the PATH, but something else is being shadowed, then we should warn about that as well.

Not sure the best way to accomplish this, probably just some which() logic.  We should probably still actually proceed with the install, though.
