Fix wrong usage of https in the monolog.xml file


The monolog.xml examples mixup 'http' and https, which results in the XML configuration being invalid.
The mixup results in the XmlFileLoader being unable to properly replace the URL with the actual local path, so he tries to load the actual URL, which is not available.
This also happened for the services.xsd - but since it's also available via URL, that's not an actual issue.
Should I also change that?
