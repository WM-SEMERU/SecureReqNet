[Security][Authentication] Interface vs implementation inconsistency


As specified in the AuthenticationManagerInterface, any implementation of AuthenticationManagerInterface::authenticate should always return a TokenInterface.  Some provided implementation do not follow the rule, examples are

AnonymousAuthenticationProvider
PreAuthenticatedAuthenticationProvider
RememberMeAuthenticationProvider
UserAuthenticationProvider

In addition, the AuthenticationProviderInterface::supports is not really an interface public method, just like the supports* method from VoterInterface are never used by caller classes.  These method are solely used as if they where protected helper functions.
These issues are not critical but may induce unexpected behaviour.  Fixing them may end in some BC break.  Any opinion ?
