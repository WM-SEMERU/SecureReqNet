What happened?
I have manually placed all the pki certs, sa cert, and ca's without the ca keys. Then I placed the conf files in the /etc/kubernetes directory. When running kubeadm init it instantly returns an error stating the ca.key doesn't exist when processing the kubeconfig files.
$ sudo kubeadm init --config /vagrant/config/clusterConfiguration.yaml
couldn't create a kubeconfig; the CA files couldn't be loaded: failed to load key: couldn't load the private key file /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key: no such file or directory

What you expected to happen?
I would expect it to verify the ca cert in the config files but without the ca.key when using an external ca. It shouldn't try loading the key since it doesn't exist.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
Generate the ca's, certs, and place the kubeconfig files and place them in the correct directories without the ca keys. Run kubeadm init and it tries to process the kubeconfig files with the key but fails cause it doesn't exist.
Anything else we need to know?
Looks like it has to do with https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kubeadm/app/phases/kubeconfig/kubeconfig.go#L133 which is called from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kubeadm/app/phases/kubeconfig/kubeconfig.go#L360 the ValidateKubeconfigsForExternalCA method.
