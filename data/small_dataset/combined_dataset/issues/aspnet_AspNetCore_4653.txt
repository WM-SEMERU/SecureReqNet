UseAuthorization middleware


UseAuthentication runs in the pipeline and automatically applies the default authentication handler. There is no corrilary for authorization. This would be useful for scenarios like authorized static files:
aspnet/AuthSamples#28.
UseAuthorization should have parameters that mimic the Authorize attribute. Failing any parameters, it should run the default policy (which is hard to do yourself https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1733).
Here's the minimal AuthN code you have to write today and it doesn't run any policy:
