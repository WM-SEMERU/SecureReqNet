Whitelist itemtype, itemid for microdata


Original issue 1950 created by kpreid@google.com on 2015-01-02T19:15:36.000Z:
User request for support for "microdata" attributes:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-caja-discuss/rNSAroM9MIU
Example markup I generated using the tool at <https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/>:
<!-- Microdata markup added by Google Structured Data Markup Helper. -->
<html><head></head><body>
<span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article&quot;&gt;&lt;p itemprop="aggregateRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/AggregateRating&quot;&gt;Testing
<span itemprop="ratingValue">123</span></p></span></body></html>
Currently, "itemtype" and "itemid" are not whitelisted; they were not included in the original HTML5-whitelisting pass because they have URI values but should not be rewritten by the URI policy (since they're URIs-as-global-names).
