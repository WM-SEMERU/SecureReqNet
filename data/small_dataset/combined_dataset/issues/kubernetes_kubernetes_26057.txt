 investigate error behaviour if disallowed sysctls are passed to Docker
 get rkt feedback /cc @s-urbaniak
 investigate implications of PodSecurityContext. Is there any policy part involved to control who can change the security context and how?
 check whether this proposal is in-line with the plan for PodSecurityContext: compare proposal and open issues of the implementation /cc @pweil-
 @vishh's comments concerning scheduler support for shared memory
