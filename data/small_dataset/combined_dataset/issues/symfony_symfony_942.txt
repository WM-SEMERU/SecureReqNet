[Security] AccessDecisionManager refactoring


Hi Fabien, hi Johannes,
I've tried to refactor the AccessDecisionManager class in the security component. I split the three access decision strategies (affirmative, consensus and unanimous) into three dedicated classes. Each strategy class implements the AccessStrategyInterface interface to enforce they have the same public API.
With this changeset, it's now easier to add new access decision strategies into the AccessDecisionManager object.
I couldn't manage to check if any regression came up because I have the following exception:
You cannot create a service ("request") of an inactive scope ("request").

I'm not sure this exception is due to my changeset. Could you please test this pull request or help me to find and understand why I have this exception.
Thanks.
Hugo.
