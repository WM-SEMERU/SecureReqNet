high DPI issue with captcha


Description
Found by @jonathansampson when testing captcha changes - Seems as though he was unable to drop the logo directly onto the target, he had to drop it a little to the right in order to successfully claim.

Attempt to claim by dropping logo directly onto target

Unable to claim by dropping logo directly onto target, had to drop a little to the right. Video by @jonathansampson is linked below.
