I was playing with PHPStan and found lots of issues in Symfony code. This PR solves some of those issues related to type mismatch in some PHP function calls:

Parameter 3 $use_include_path of function fopen() expects bool, null given.
Parameter 3 $atime of function touch() expects int, int|null given.
Parameter 1 $prefix of function uniqid() expects string, int given.
Parameter 2 $subject of function preg_match() expects string, int|string given.

There are many more issues. I'm not sure if you want me to update this PR to fix all of them ... or close this as "not worth it". Thanks.
