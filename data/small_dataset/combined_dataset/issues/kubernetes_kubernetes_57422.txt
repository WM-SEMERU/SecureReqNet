Rework method of updating atomic-updated data volumes


What this PR does / why we need it:
This change affects the way that secret, configmap, downwardAPI and projected volumes (which all use the same underlying code) implement their data update functionality.

Instead of creating a subdirectory hierarchy that will contain symlinks to each actual data file, create only symlinks to items in the root of the volume, whether they be files or directories.
Rather than comparing the user-visible data directory to see if an update is needed, compare with the current version of the data directory.
Fix data dir timestamp format year
Create ..data symlink even when a data volume has no data so consumers can have simplified update watch logic.

Which issue(s) this PR fixes:
Fixes #57421
Fixes #60814 for master / 1.10
Release note:
Fix a bug affecting nested data volumes such as secret, configmap, etc.
