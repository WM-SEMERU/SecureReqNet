phpunit command does not respect SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_VERSION in phpunit.xml/.env


Symfony version(s) affected: phpunit 4.1
Description
Based on how environment variables are read:
https://github.com/symfony/phpunit-bridge/blob/b3451fc442baaf9169e50491a059ef17582c4424/bin/simple-phpunit#L18-L46
the phpunit command flat out overrides the variables:
SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_VERSION
SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_REMOVE
SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_DIR
https://github.com/symfony/recipes/blob/master/symfony/phpunit-bridge/4.1/bin/phpunit
E.g. it currently hardcodes phpunit to v6.5.
This seems like a bug, especially given that the docs explicitly say

PHPUnit is configured by the phpunit.xml.dist file in the root of your Symfony application.

You also can't define them in the .env files either.
How to reproduce
Install the website-skeleton, try to define the SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_VERSION variable in your phpunit.xml (or any of the variables ./bin/phpunit overrides) and see it fail.
Possible Solution
Better logic in getting the env variables? (In bin/simple-phpunit.)
Maybe also start reading .env files? At which point also decide on a priority, e.g. env > phpunit.xml > phpunit.xml.dist. Don't have insight on this though.
