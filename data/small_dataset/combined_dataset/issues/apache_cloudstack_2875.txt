CertUtils: export private key to pem format correctly


This makes openssl rsa -in  -check pass, due to "RSA" string the
validate of private key (pem file) by openssl fails. Also removes
a commented import.
Without this fix, in some systems the key/crt could not be reused. Following error was observed in openssl:
$ openssl rsa -in  -check
RSA key ok

With this fix, the private key pem file will pass. Openssl output:
$ openssl rsa -in  -check
RSA key ok
writing RSA key
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
