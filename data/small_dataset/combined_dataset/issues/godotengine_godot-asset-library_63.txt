Asset downloads: enforce the usage of a commit hash or tag zip archive (and thus single repo per asset)


We currently took a loose approach for assets, allowing people to give a directly URL to a potentially self-hosted zip archive. Reviewing the currently approved assets show a big variety of usages, but it's quickly become hard to maintain and encourages bad practices (like uploading static zip archives directly in the git repo to download as raw files).
After discussing it with @reduz on tonight's IRC meeting, we thought that it would be better to go back to the initial design:

Asset submitters should have to give the following information:

GitHub repository URL, e.g. https://github.com/KOBUGE-Games/godot-logger (or other source hosting providers if we can handle their respective APIs)
Commit hash or git tag, e.g. 74c2903670b30ec36ad306006f82d1f27dd8757b
The download zip would thus get automatically generated (e.g. https://github.com/KOBUGE-Games/godot-logger/archive/74c2903670b30ec36ad306006f82d1f27dd8757b.zip), we don't ask for a download URL


This means 1 GitHub (or other supported provider) repo == 1 addon. It won't be possible to version several plugins in the same repo (or they would be distributed all at once :p).
Security wise, it's much better, as we can check the contents of the git repo visually without having to download a Dropbox-hosted zip archive, extract it and check the contents.

It should be relatively straightforward to implement as most of the logic is there already, and building the URL for the GitHub API is easy.
Question: what other providers do we want to support if any, and how?
