Is there anywhere a log for keeweb?


My last synchronization was on 13.01.19
I load my keepass file over dropbox but after 13.01.19 the syncronization fails with the message
Error: Network error
I can read all passwords but I can not save new entries.

So, is there any way to read the log file to identify the error or is this a known issue?
If i click Syncronization the endpoint get_metadata replies with a 302 Status.
I also noticed that the site is not secure.

Kind regards
