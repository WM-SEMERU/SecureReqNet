no options are passed to webtorrent torrent.createServer()


in extension/background/webtorrent.ts, torrent.createServer() is called without any arguments.
the equivalent code for browser-laptop is here: https://github.com/dcposch/webtorrent-remote/blob/master/server.js#L202
opts is set in js/webtorrent/entry.js in browser-laptop:
  server = torrent.createServer({
    // Only allow requests from this origin ('chrome-extension://...) so websites
    // cannot violate same-origin policy by reading contents of active torrents.
    origin: window.location.origin,
    // Use hostname option to mitigate DNS rebinding (#12616)
    hostname: webtorrentServerHostname
  })

As noted in the comments, both the origin and hostname options are security critical. It appears they are not set in brave-core, but I could be missing something.
