I think the root of the problem is that closed milestones are not eligible to receive issue assignment. My steps to reproduce:

1. Create new milestone ``Test Milestone``
2. Create new issue ``Test Issue against Milestone``
3. Close ``Test Milestone``

At this point, the milestone will still show the issue as assigned. If you were to view the issue itself, it would show no milestone assigned. Everything is still OK at this point, although there's a minor UI issue of not showing the assigned milestone when that milestone is closed. 

4. Edit the issue (e.g. subject line)

Because the milestone field is unpopulated, this "empty" value is stored as the milestone assignment and thus the issue is disassociated from the milestone. This causes a loss in history for tracking when issues were resolved. 

I think it would correct to say that only open milestones -or- currently assigned milestone are eligible for issue assignment.
