Loosen precision of timestamp in initiation message


Right now the timestamp field of the initiation message is too precise due (TimeStamper::stamp). It should be truncated to avoid acting as a time oracle which could aid in other attacks.
The Linux kernel implementation choses to truncate the value based on the possible number of initiations per second, see WireGuard/WireGuard@c62836e.
