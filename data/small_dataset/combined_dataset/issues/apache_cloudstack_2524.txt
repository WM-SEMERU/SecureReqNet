[CLOUDSTACK-9261] Upgrate jQuery-UI to 1.11 (JQuery UI 1.8.4 prone to XSS)


Description
This PR addresses an old security issue regarding jQuery-UI. We are updating jQuery-UI to version 1.11, instead of 1.12, because the 1.12 version requires an update of jQuery.js as well. Therefore, to reduce the surface of changes, we are first only updating the jQuery-UI library.
Moreover, unnecessary CSS and image files from the jQuery-UI library were deleted.

How Has This Been Tested?
I tested the changes introduced here by generating the RMP packages, updating ACS in a test environment and then using ACS UI to see if I something is not working. So far I have tracked and fixed all of the problems I encountered. I would like to get some help on testing this as well. Therefore, if you have some minutes/hours to spare, please do help.
