Trailing slash dropped for form action URLs in ES5/3

What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
Rev 5643, Caja playground, Chrome 31.0.1650.63
What steps will reproduce the problem?

Cajole the following code:

<form action="http://www.example.com/foobar/">
<input type="text" name="foo" />
</form>
â€‹
What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the form action URL to be preserved. Instead the trailing slash is dropped.
Please provide any additional information below.
Some servers behave differently depending on whether there is a trailing slash or not so Caja should preserve it.
