OpenSocial taming.js isn't secure


Original issue 1096 created by erights on 2009-08-07T18:47:07.000Z:
While we don't know of anyone whose security currently depends on
<http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/features/src/main/javascript/features/caja/taming.js>,
I am first disclosing this somewhat privately because we don't know who
might be. Unfortunately, we thus have no ability to responsibly disclose to
these unknown possible users. Given that the only people who could benefit
from early disclosure can only be reached if we disclose openly, should we?
taming.js looks like it has several problems. At least:


Several property names ending in single underbar, especially "super_",
look like they should have been hidden. I suspect these date from when a
single underbar hid properties in the Original-Caja language. This can be
trivially fixed by renaming these to end in wonderbar (triple underbar)
instead.


None of this taming should have made use of $v. The taming should all be
at the Cajita level but compatible with Valija, by calling back function
arguments with
___.callPub(callback, 'call', [...])


That works whether callback is a (Cajita) simple function or a (Valija)
disfunction.

The taming is done by replacing members of 'gadgets' and 'opensocial' in
place and then exporting those. Since these are records, this amounts to a
blcklisting approach, since all mentionable properties of records are
implicitly accessible. Instead, the exported 'gadgets' and 'opensocial'
should be membrane-like records of wrappers wrapping the unmodified members
of the original records.
Several of the new methods unnecessarily mention "this", likely opening
up further holes, though I haven't tried to identify any concrete ones yet.
