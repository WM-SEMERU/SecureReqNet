Current behavior:
$qProvider.errorOnUnhandledRejections(false) suppresses all errors not just unhandled rejections.
Expected / new behavior:
$qProvider.errorOnUnhandledRejections(false) should only suppress unhandled rejection errors.
Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions:
http://plnkr.co/edit/9lpc6KBgtSqOmxzn8ej4?p=preview
AngularJS version: 1.7.5
Browser: all
Anything else:
The issue in it's current form makes it extremely hard to catch REAL errors and send them to our error logging platform (Sentry)

errorOnUnhandledRejections(false) results in no real errors at all being observed in console or  $exceptionHandler
errorOnUnhandledRejections(true) results in tens of thousands of "Possibly unhandled rejection" errors being sent to Sentry, even though there are no real issues.

It's worth adding that we intentionally do not catch quite a lot of our promises as we expect them to result in no more actions.
