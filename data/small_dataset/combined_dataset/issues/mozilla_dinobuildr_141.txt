Stop using code in other repos


We do two sketchy things in our build. We pull down python scripts from forked repos, pin their commit hashes and execute them via curl:



dinobuildr/repo/dock-config.sh


        Lines 17 to 27
      in
      b58ee98






 dockutil=$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/dockutil/26b13d380f67dc79251cf0ea6280dbaa603308be/scripts/dockutil) 



 



 if [ $(echo "$dockutil" | shasum -a 256 | awk {'print $1'}) == $hash ]; then #  if the hashes match then proceed 



 echo "Executing dockutil - hash matches expected value." 



     python -c "$dockutil" --remove all --no-restart 



     python -c "$dockutil" --add "/Applications/Launchpad.app" --position beginning --no-restart 



     python -c "$dockutil" --add "/Applications/Firefox.app" --after Launchpad --no-restart 



     python -c "$dockutil" --add "/Applications/VidyoDesktop.app" --after Firefox --no-restart 



     python -c "$dockutil" --add "/Applications/CrashPlan.app" --after VidyoDesktop --no-restart 



     python -c "$dockutil" --add "~/Downloads" --view fan --display stack --section others --no-restart 



     python -c "$dockutil" --add "/Applications/System Preferences.app" --position end 








dinobuildr/repo/wallpaper.sh


        Lines 48 to 53
      in
      b58ee98






 WALLPAPER_SH=$(curl -sc - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/macos-desktop/abfb607953e0c789bb8e853ec28f545e89ddebbe/set-desktop-mojave.sh) 



 HASH="50b049f9cf9a57582fa83f411b66c61fed854f553102c05ca91cbd249cdb9ac8" # change only after thorough testing 



 



 if [ $(echo "$WALLPAPER_SH" | shasum -a 256 | awk {'print $1'}) == $HASH ]; then #  if the hashes match then proceed 



 echo "We're on Mojave (or newer) so we're going to use the new way to set the wallpaper." 



     /bin/bash -c "$WALLPAPER_SH" -s "/Users/Shared/$WALLPAPER_FILENAME" 





While this is "safe" enough for our purposes, since the repos are forked and we hash pin, we should stop doing this altogether because we can't lint these scripts.
Of course, we also can't lint binaries that we pull down for our build, but this seems like a thing we could stop doing and it would make the build easier to understand. I believe the best solution is to simply pull these scripts into dinobuildr, and make dinobuildr understand how to natively execute python.
