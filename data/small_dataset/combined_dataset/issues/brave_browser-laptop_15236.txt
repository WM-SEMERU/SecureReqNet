Tab contents do not resize after moving to different monitor


Description
The contents of a tab do not resize if the tab is moved from one monitor to another that has a different resolution.
Steps to Reproduce

Get yourself two monitors; this behaviour does not occur with two windows on the same monitor.
Open a Brave window on both monitors. The windows should have a different sizeâ€”the bigger the difference the easier it is to notice. It does not matter if they are maximised.
Drag a tab from one window to the other, so that one of the windows now has two tabs.
