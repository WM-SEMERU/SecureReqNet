FEATURE REQUEST
What would I like to be added:
Currently, the user can change kubelet's run-time directory by setting "root-dir" in the kubeletExtraArgs field of nodeRegistration object. While this flag does alter kubelet's behavior, kubeadm still writes the configuration files for kubelet under /var/lib/kubelet.
So, kubeadm should have its own parameter for the kubelet run-time directory to which it will write the configuration files. It can also pass the value of this parameter (if provided) to kubelet instead of using the kubeletExtraArgs map.
Why is this needed:
I'm running K8S on a VM with two volumes - a limited boot volume and a configurable (to be much larger) data volume. So, I'm trying to move run-time data from the boot volume to the data volume. I've already set docker and kubelet to use the data volume, and I would like to have kubeadm do the same
