Discussing with @simensen, we figured out the currently logged messages are not precise enough.
Logging is a cross-cutting concern: splitting it in a dedicated middleware means losing details - or building complexity.
Let's make things simple and log the best messages depending on the internal situation.
While the component is experimental, removing the LoggingMiddleware altogether would break FrameworkBundle 4.2 when it is used with Messenger 4.3. Not worth the trouble when it's two lines to deprecate IMHO.
