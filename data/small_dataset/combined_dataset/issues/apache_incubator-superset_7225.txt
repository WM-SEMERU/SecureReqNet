Changing viz type also re-sets metric back to count(*)


Repro:
(1) Line chart with a count(distinct names) metric
(2) Change to deck.gl polygon
(3) Note that metric gets reset back to count(*)
Viz type switching should persist metric--at least the first metric if there are > 1 on previous viz type

 I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
 I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
 I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.
