General sync issues / Cross - platform


Description
Creating an issue where we can link to reviews or feedback from users that have sync issues.
Often users don't provide too much info so it will be hard to troubleshoot.


I'm having issues Syncing all my devices. I have two Windows 10 PC's which refuse to Sync unless they start the sync chain. Two Android devices and a third Windows 10 PC have no issues syncing. Update: Same issue after update, but now bookmark shortcut changed
