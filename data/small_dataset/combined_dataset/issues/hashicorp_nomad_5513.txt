Plugin Agent Fingerprint Override


Nomad version
Nomad v0.9.0-rc1 (7c00ab4)
Issue
While developing the nomad-driver-triton plugin (https://github.com/smithx10/nomad-driver-triton) I've stumbled upon the need to over-ride the Nomad Agents Fingerprinter.   The triton plugin runs instances that are remote from the agent,  and I'd like a method in the plugin that will return the agent's fingerprint.  I imagine I'd query the Triton API to get Tenant Limits and populate the fingerprinter.  For the time being,  I've hacked around this issue by making every allocation very small.
Reproduction steps
N/A.
