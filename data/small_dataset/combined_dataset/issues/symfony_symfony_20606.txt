[security] Class __PHP_Incomplete_Class has no unserializer


Hello,
It is a pretty weird bug as always for this one.
I use silex, not symfony, but the problem is on the securityComponent, so not especially related to silex.


The message is :
Warning: Class __PHP_Incomplete_Class has no unserializer in /var/www/project/vendor/symfony/security/Core/Authentication/Token/AbstractToken.php on line 164


The class it is talking about is DoctrineProxies_CG_\App\Entity\User (unserialize_callback_func is telling me).


My user implement Serializable with id, username, password.


On the application, I use subdomain to identify a company (I have a Company entity with a slug property). I also have some special subdomain, as "manager" for example.


My session domain is the TLD, so when I'm logged on a company, I'm logged on every company, on the manager etc... (There is a /login on every subdomain, but for each it is the same function called).


And there is the problem. Everything work fine until I add a ManyToOne relationship  on the company to an User :


class Company
{

    /**
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="User")
     */
    private $creator;

Now, let's say I log in on the "manager" subdomain. It's working. I switch on a company URL, still working, I'm logged. I switch again to manager, bug append (see the warning).
Another try : I log in directly on a company subdomain ("anonymous" pages are okay, not logged, working). Bug append directly.
Bug vanish as soon I remove the relation (I still have to clear my session cookie).
Soo, I tried some changes in my code, in listeners, in "company management", but still. So before break the app more deeply, I wanted to ask security pro players.
Also, bug is the same on production environment (well, the project is not really in production yet, internal beta).
