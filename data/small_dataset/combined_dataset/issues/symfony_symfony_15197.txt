Security bug? on HttpException


I recently upgraded my version of Symfony from 2.3 to 2.7.
On my project I have a sidebar, which show the login and, if the user is logged, their user panel, with his avatar, his nickname and a couple of options like edit profile.
I have installed FOSUserBundle for it.
When Symfony2 launch an 404, 500, 401... exception error, randomly, the avatar and nickname displayed on the control panel, modified, showing data of another user.
In version 2.3 I had this never occurred.
It may be a bugÂ¿
