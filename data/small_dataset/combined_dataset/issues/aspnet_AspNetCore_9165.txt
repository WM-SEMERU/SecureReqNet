Netcore debugging broken on macOS in preview4 nightly


Up to preview 3 one could use VS Code or VS Mac (with some issues) to compile, run and debug netcore3 projects. From a couple of weeks ago the nightly builds of preview 4 do not debug, I submitted a bug to the omnisharp project. It was analysed and determined that the issue is in the coreclr project.
The relevant issue is: dotnet/coreclr#23773
What happens is that coreclr throws an exception on the start of debugging. This basically renders the macOS platform incapable of any netcore work until this is resolved.
I'm just logging it here for reference in case someone comes across this issue after preview 4 is released.
