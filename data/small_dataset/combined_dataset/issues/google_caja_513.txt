Check for each browser that '({}) instanceof x' throws if x is not a function


Original issue 513 created by davidsarah.hopwood on 2008-06-11T21:44:12.000Z:
Check for each browser that '({}) instanceof x' throws if x is not a
function. We are assuming that, because the expansion of instanceof does
not check that x is a function. ECMA-262 doesn't explicitly define the
behaviour if it isn't.
Initial testing on Firefox and IE seems to suggest that they do check, but
Safari and Opera have not been tested.
