Misleading information in the security docs


The first header of Using the form_login Authentication Provider is named “form_login Setup”;
At the same time, there is another page named How to Build a Login Form with the url .../form_login_setup, which uses MakerBundle and Guard to make the same thing, having nothing to do with the form_login provider.
This is highly misleading.
There is an information box on top of that page speaking about the form_login provider, but that's only helpful for those who know what an authentication provider is, which is not the case for beginners.
