js/lib/request.js should use non-persistent session by default


Test plan
#12694 (comment)

currently it uses the default session, which may write data (cache, etc.) to disk. it is better to use a non-persistent session to prevent leaks from private browsing.
no-qa-needed except to test for regressions
