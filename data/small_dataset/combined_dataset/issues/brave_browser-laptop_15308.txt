Can you add 'tara' to  which is Mint 19 codename?





browser-laptop/tools/upload_to_aptly


         Line 10
      in
      1380864






 DIST='artful zesty yakkety xenial jessie trusty serena stretch bionic buster' 





otherwise I had to change file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release-tara.list
and replace
deb [arch=amd64] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ tara main
to
deb [arch=amd64] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ bionic main
Thank you.
