version checking


Original issue 495 created by felix8a on 2008-06-11T04:10:04.000Z:
security of a cajoled gadget is dependent on caja.js staying in sync with
the output of the cajoler.  so, a container could put the caja version
number in the url for caja.js.  and it can also attach caja version to the
cajoled output, so that the container's runtime code can do a version check
before allowing the cajoled gadget to run.
maybe this integrity check should be a part of caja.
