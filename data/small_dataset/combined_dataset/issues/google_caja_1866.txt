Investigate minifier bug / upgrade JS processing libraries


Original issue 1868 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-10-29T23:46:31.000Z:
I tried upgrading the versions of acorn and escodegen in our third_party. This resulted in a bug where the minified version only of mitigateSrcGotchas would mangle regexp literals by doubling characters: /ab/ becoming /aabb/.
This indicates a serious bug in our minifier, since it should not be changing the semantics of the code. We should either fix it or replace it with Closure Compiler (see issue 1866).
We should also upgrade acorn/estraverse/escodegen just to stay current on upstream fixes and API changes.
