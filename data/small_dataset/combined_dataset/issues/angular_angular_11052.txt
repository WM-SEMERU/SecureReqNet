[Question][Security] ngNonBindable elements


The template parser uses 2 visitors:

1 for regular nodes,
1 for non bindable nodes (NonBindableVisitor)

Seems like security/schema checks are only used in the former one.
Could this be a vulnerability that would allow JS injections ?
I don't have time to investigate more for now
