Hi guys!
This is a revert for #18510 (ping @iltar), which is a nice idea, but will have some big practical implications:


You are only allowed to type-hint the argument with UserInterface exactly. For the 90% of Symfony project's that user a User entity for their User, this will be weird: I'll receive a UserInterface, that immediately call methods on it that aren't in the interface (and also, your IDE won't give you auto-completion). And as #18510 mentions, we can't allow people to type-hint their concrete User class, because this will conflict with SensioFWExtraBundle ParamConverter if there is a user id in the URL


Deprecating and removing $this->getUser() in a controller is a step back. Where we can, let's make controllers and services act more like each other. You can't call $this->getUser() in a service, but at least if you look at this method in Controller, you can see that it uses security.token_storage - which is how you will get the User object if you need it from within services.


Sorry for being late on this original issue! It looked good to me at first :).
Cheers!
