'### Problem to solve

Related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/57918, there's no way to currently rotate tokens for feature flags. We should add this capability so that project owners are able to ensure the security of their feature flags and projects over time.

### Target audience

- Devon, DevOps Engineer, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas#devon-devops-engineer

- Sidney, Systems Administrator, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas#sidney-systems-administrator

### Further details

<!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) -->

### Proposal

<!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey -->

### Permissions and Security

<!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)? -->

### Documentation

<!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html
Add all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements -->

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

<!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. -->
