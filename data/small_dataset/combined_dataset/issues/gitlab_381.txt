This feature request it's two folded:

a) Either improve the UI for assigning the same deployment key to several projects at once, or to several groups.

b) Decoupling the from a single project. 

In buildout projects is common to have several dozens of projects being deployed to staging servers in order to test integration between all components.  

Having to manually assign the same deployment key to each project is teadious.  Allowing to have group-level keys would be very useful in this cases.  Alternatively, the UI for the assignment of the same deployment key to several projects is also a solution to this.
