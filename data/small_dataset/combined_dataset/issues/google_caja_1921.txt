Protect Caja JSONP responses against “Rosetta Flash” vulnerability


Original issue 1923 created by kpreid@google.com on 2014-07-09T23:14:03.000Z:
Any domain (origin) containing the cajoling service or proxy service is vulnerable.
Introduction to the vulnerability:
http://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/
We should apply these known mitigations:

Add a fixed prefix (such as comment) to the JSONP response, before the user-supplied callback.
Responses should have Content-Disposition:attachment.
Responses should have X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

This must be done separately on trunk and es53 branches, because on trunk the ProxyServlet has been refactored to remove the more general cajoling service mechanisms.
