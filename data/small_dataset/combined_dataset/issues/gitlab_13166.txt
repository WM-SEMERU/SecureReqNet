If you include an image that comes from an HTTP connection and
GitLab is set up to use TLS, then you get mixed content issues.
See for example https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/13162.

GitHub is using https://github.com/atmos/camo, a Node.js proxy to serve all images.

Diaspora is also using it https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Installation/Camo

I think it would be cool to support it.
