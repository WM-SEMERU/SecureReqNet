Fixes:
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\TraceableTagAwareAdapter::__destruct() in /usr/sf/var/cache/dev/ContainerOjtvevg/TagAwareAdapter_5b4740c.php:128
Stack trace:
#0 [internal function]: TagAwareAdapter_5b4740c->__destruct()

When setting a TagAwareAdapter as cache service.
In my case it was a custom TagAwareAdapter (which does not decorate other cache services), but I think the issue is probably also there if you use the default TagAwareAdapter and set it as cache service.
