[Validator] Use Expression constraint on raw values


Description
Currently we can't use the Expression constraint with raw value. I don't actually know if it's more a bug or a not implemented feature. Whatever, it would be great to make it possible!
Example
$input = [ 'level' => 3, 'money' => 4Â ];

$validator = \Symfony\Component\Validator\Validation::createValidator();
$violations = $validator->validate($input, new Assert\Expression(
    "this['money'] > this['level']" // here this is null
));
Get the error: Unable to get an item on a non-array.
