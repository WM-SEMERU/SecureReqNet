CloudStack management java.security.ciphers has no effect on JVM process


The /etc/cloudstack/management/java.security.ciphers has no effect on the list of disabled TLS algorithms in the management server JVM process. For example, on port 8250 TLS1.0, 1.1 are still allowed/supported protocols. (Tested using openssl s_client -connect localhost:8250 -tls1)
However, workaround exists to configure jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms in the global security file: $JRE_HOME/lib/security/java.security.
