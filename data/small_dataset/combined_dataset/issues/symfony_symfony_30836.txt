Hi!
In #30814, we decided to base64_encode the serialized messages to avoid null characters, which can cause issues persisting on some databases and I also think Amazon SQS does not like them **(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html),  for example.
The only downside is that the messages become unreadable. I thought about that more, that's really unfortunate: if I'm using some sort of a 3rd party tool (like RabbitMQ's admin dashboard) to inspect the messages, they are fully unreadable. PHP Serialized messages are ugly, but you can absolutely understand them as a human.
This proposal is to consider using json_encode() instead. In both cases, it's a bit awkward: the PhpSerializer is not really a PhpSerializer, but a PhpSerialize that is then encoded again to avoid null characters. base64_encode is a really "pure" way to do this, but json_encode (which, unfortunately requires an extra "array") is a lot more readable.
Cheers!
