Drag and drop not working cdkDragBoundary in Responsive layout


Hi,
I am using Angular CDK 7.3.7  Drag and drop with cdkDragBoundary. Its working fine until the screen size changed, if I changed then the boundary restriction is not working perfectly ie the restriction area  not changing as per new dimension of  responsive layout.
Is it know issue or do i need to do anything in my coding. I am using Angular through webpack hook for customize as per project requirement. Please find the version I am using
