npm install (6.1.0) doesn't update package-lock.json when using Git URL as dependency


I'm opening this issue because:

 npm is crashing.
 npm is producing an incorrect install.
 npm is doing something I don't understand.
 npm is producing incorrect or undesirable behavior.
 Other (see below for feature requests):

What's going wrong?
npm install (6.1.0) doesn't update package-lock.json when using Git URL as dependency. In our team, devs are using npm i while devops are using npm ci, so that the application behaves quite differently during the deliver cycle due to inconsistent lock packages. This issue doesn't exist in npm 5.7.0 and below.
How can the CLI team reproduce the problem?

git clone https://github.com/fzheng/package.lock.master
package.json in package.lock.master is

"dependencies": {
    "package.lock.slave": "git+ssh://git@github.com/fzheng/package.lock.slave.git#master"
}


package-lock.json in package.lock.master is

"dependencies": {
    "package.lock.slave": {
      "version": "git+ssh://git@github.com/fzheng/package.lock.slave.git#a315ce7d158fd7b490a7d92b286a91ef2c6c6b1b",
      "from": "git+ssh://git@github.com/fzheng/package.lock.slave.git#master"
    }
}


Please notice that in https://github.com/fzheng/package.lock.slave, the latest git commit is 1c01d, not a315c. Commit 1c01d is to calculate cubic, while Commit a315c is to calculate square.
Please do npm install in package.lock.master

$ npm i
added 1 package from 1 contributor and audited 1 package in 2.101s
found 0 vulnerabilities

please notice that the package-lock.json wasn't updated even though the dependency has a new commit, however, node index.js still somehow uses the latest code from dependency.
$ node index.js 3
27


Please rm -rf node_modules and do npm ci in package.lock.master.

$ npm ci
added 1 packages in 1.357s

please notice that this time, node index.js generates square result.
$ node index.js 3
