Azure Storage Driver should allow customization of secret location


From @liggitt :
In the process of provisioning a PV, it creates a secret in the namespace of the PVC containing the account name and key (password) needed to mount the PV. This secret is visible to a namespace-limited user.
Steps:

Run a cluster with
the azure cloud provider
dynamic PV provisioning enabled
a storage class specified for the azure file dynamic provisioner
kube-controller-manager set to --use-service-account-credentials=false (the default) OR with the persistent-volume-binder service account given permission to create secrets
As a namespace-limited user, create a PVC requesting the azure file storageclass

Result:
Depending on your authorization policy, a secret with the password for the storage account is created in the same namespace as the PVC.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/azure/azure_storage.go#L273
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/azure_file/azure_util.go#L78
Note:
If the cluster is running with RBAC authorization only, and the controller manager is running with --use-service-account-credentials, the persistent-volume-binder role does not permit creation of secrets, so the Provision() operation would fail, and the credentials would not be exposed.
We should update the PVC controller so that the namespace where the secret is created is customizable.
