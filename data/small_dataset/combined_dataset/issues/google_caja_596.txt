domita.js etc. should be more careful about its use of regexps


Original issue 596 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-13T08:47:03.000Z:
domita.js (and similar .js files) are not written in Caja.  Therefore they
must be careful about their use of regexps, to avoid the crazy behaviors.
Background (as I understand it): The hazards of Regexp are described in
issue # 528, if r is a RegExp, then r.exec() and r.test() leak information
about other strings passed to other RegExp objects (even in other gadgets).
I suspect that r.exec(undefined) will be equivalent to r.exec(), and
similarly for r.test().  If this is right, it means that everywhere that
your Javascript uses RegExp.exec(s) or RegExp.test(s), you must first test
to make sure that s !== undefined.
There are various places that call RegExp.test(x) in domita.js and
html-sanitizer.js.  I did not find any where it's possible to have
x===undefined, but this pattern is slightly fragile, so I thought I'd
mention it here as a hazard.
Perhaps this is an argument for writing that code in Caja so that it
benefits from however issue # 528 is resolved?
