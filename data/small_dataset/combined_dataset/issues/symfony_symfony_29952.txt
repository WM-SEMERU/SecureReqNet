[Lock] SemaphoreStore : sem_remove() produces a warning


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4.20 / PHP 7.2.5
Description
As stated in #27357 (comment), when I use the LockableTrait in command :
protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output): int
{
    if (!$this->lock()) {
        $output->writeln('The command is already running in another process.');
    
        return 0;
    }

    // ...

    $this->release();
}
A warning is emitted :

Warning: sem_remove(): failed for SysV sempphore 140713294922928: Operation not permitted {"exception":"[object] (ErrorException(code: 0): Warning: sem_remove(): failed for SysV sempphore 140713294922928: Operation not permitted at /path/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Lock/Store/SemaphoreStore.php:113

The command is executed by a cronjob under an user and Unix group different of those of webserver.
How to reproduce
Pre-prod and prod are impacted but I don't know how to reproduce exactly.
Possible Solution
As the warning seems to be non-blocking, I suggest to silence the call to sem_remove() as done with @sem_acquire().
Let me know if I can make the PR.
