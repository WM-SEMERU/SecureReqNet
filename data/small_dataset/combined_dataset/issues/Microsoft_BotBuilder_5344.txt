QnAMaker.GetAnswersAsync() takes a TurnContext instead of a string


Issue
Describe the issue you are addressing
QnAMaker.GetAnswersAsync() just takes a TurnContext, and assumes you want to query QnAMaker using the text in the TurnContext. But you may want to call QnAMaker with a modified version of the text, or a different string altogether. It would be better if GetAnswersAsync() took a string instead, as it would provide more flexibility to customers.
Proposed change
Describe the proposed solution
GetAnswers() should take a string.
