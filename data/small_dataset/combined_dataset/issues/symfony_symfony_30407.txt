[Serializer] Deprecate PropertyNormalizer::isAllowedAttribute


I would like to deprecate PropertyNormalizer::isAllowedAttribute as this method should not be override the AbstractNormalizer::isAllowedAttribute.
The extra $reflectionProperty->isStatic() check could easily introduced in PropertyNormalizer::extractAttributes (like in other normalizers).
I tried to implement this but don't know how to deprecate the PropertyNormalizer::isAllowedAttribute method.
How can I deprecate a protected method which override it's parent?
