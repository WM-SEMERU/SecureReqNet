When using the Forms entrypoint to configure the component, there was no chance to configure dependencies of the CoreExtension, as the one registered without argument was first and would win.
The builder now delays the prepending of the CoreExtension to do it only if the CoreExtension is not registered explicitly.
We discovered that when trying to fix tests for the FileType, where we wanted to pass a Translator to it.
