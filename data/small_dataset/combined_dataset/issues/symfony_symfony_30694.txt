Feature Request: Apply validation constraints to form types, even if guessing is disabled


After having spent the entire day investigating how the interplay of constraints, validation groups and the type guesser works (see EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle#2673 and #27881 and symfony/symfony-docs#11222 and symfony/symfony-docs#11223 ), I came to the conclusion that the current behavior is, sorry, bullshit.
I bet that nobody in the world would expect that if you cange
$builder->add('firstName')
to
$builder->add('firstName', TextType::class)
... this will significantly affect the way your form is rendered!
So I'm suggesting: Take whatever is found in any validation constraint and always apply it to the form's field options automatically.
I deliberately don't use the term "guessing" here (as e.g. in #18706 (comment) ), since there's nothing to guess: If I have a Length(max="5") constraint in my entity, anybody will immediately know which value I want to have for the maxlength attribute ;-) And even after thinking about it for several hours, I can't see any reason why I would not want to have maxlength included in the HTML at all. (And even if I would, I could still override it manually).
Yes, this would be a BC break. But it would result in a more consistent and therefore predictable way of how forms are rendered!
