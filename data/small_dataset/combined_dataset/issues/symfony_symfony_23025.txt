Since Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Role\RoleInterface is deprecated, there is no possibility to create a Role entity anymore. Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Role\Role::$role is private and extending the Role class doesn't allow to add mapping to that property.
I suggest making $role protected. If I am not mistaken this won't break existing child classes.
