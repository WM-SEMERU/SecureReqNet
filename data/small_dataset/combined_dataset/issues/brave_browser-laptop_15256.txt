Open in new tab option appears for non links, and then doesn't open when selected


Description
The option to "Open Link in new tab" appears when you highlight text such as this below but then a white page is loaded when selected (Note: It's not actually a link!):

Here's the link to that page: https://www.tivix.com/blog/dont-forget-the-back-button-in-your-single-page-ap
Steps to Reproduce

Go to https://www.tivix.com/blog/dont-forget-the-back-button-in-your-single-page-ap
Search for Fireworks.com
Highlight Fireworks.com
Right click and select any option such as "Open Link in new tab" or "Open Link in new private tab" etc

Actual result:
Empty page opens.
Expected result:
The link is opened just as if it would be if it was a "real" link to the site. I think that's a nice feature. If that's too much work then don't have these options when you right click the highlighted text I guess.
