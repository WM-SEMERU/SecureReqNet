Bypassing the firewall using the app.php file?


Hi,
I was testing the security component and after adding a firewall in the /test section, it works as expected, asking user for login.
But when accessing /app.php/test or /app_dev.php/test user is not asked to enter login/password and firewall is bypassed.
Checking inside the controller if user is logged fixes the problem.
Thanks!! :)
