Permission / Access Control on list view


Forwarding issue to Github for tracking. It was found that access control applies only for internal screens and not for list view. Hence details on sales order / purchase order etc are viewed by all inspite of bringing access control on them. Please address this issue at the earliest.
Thanks,
Vikram

HI Umair,
This has worked once and have been able to restrict the various users from
viewing prices. However in the basic screen wherein for example all the
purchase orders are listed, the PO amount are coming up even though the
user does not have access inside.
E.g.: PO00229 is showing the amount here in below screenshot even though it
does not show the same in the detailed screen. How can this be controlled?

Hello Vikram,
You can use Perm Level functionality for field level permissions.

For permission to report, they will atleast need "Read" permission. The
idea is if they can read/access transaction details in the report, then why
not in transaction directly. Its one and the same thing.
