Allow packager to output a different CFBundleName for the macOS packager


Usage: BUNDLE_NAME="My\ App" CHANNEL=nightly npm run build-package
Background for this is at brave/brave-browser#1914 (comment)
Note that the name of the app is still cached somewhere. Only method I've found to clear that cache is to restart the system.
We also need to verify that the upgrade process replaces this value in the user's Info.plist.
