### Problem to solve
Allow clients to use redis with SSL (rediss://) connections.

### Further details

The Ruby library redis-rb already has [support for `rediss://`](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb#ssltls-support), so I wouldn't imagine it would be too difficult to add support in Gitlab (or maybe it already works? Just needs a way to specify the cert file?)

### Proposal

Allow clients to pass in / provide options to connect using `rediss://`.

Something like the following (maybe):
```
gitlab_rails['redis_host'] = 'rediss://my.remote.rediss.deploy'
gitlab_rails['redis_port'] = 55555
gitlab_rails['redis_password'] = 'redis_password'
gitlab_rails['redis_ssl_cert'] = '/path/to/cert.cert'
```

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

Success would be if a client could connect using `rediss://` instead of only `redis://`
