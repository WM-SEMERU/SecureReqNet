[Debug][DebugClassLoader] Reflect on the same vendor concept


The DebugClassLoader don't trigger deprecations for classes that are considered in the same vendor. The definition of being in the same vendor is hardcoded as both first namespaces parts (before the first \) being equals. However, this is not always true.
For example, in Drupal, you write your custom code in modules. Your custom module namespace must be Drupal\your_module_name\. Drupal core itself is under the Drupal namespace as well (eg Drupal\Component\DependencyInjection). That means that your module is considered as being in the same vendor, so extending a core Drupal @internal class in your module doesn't trigger any deprecation for example.
Proposed solutions :

Provide a way to specify how deep the check on the namespace comparison should be
Or provide a way to specify namespaces that should trigger deprecations no matter what
