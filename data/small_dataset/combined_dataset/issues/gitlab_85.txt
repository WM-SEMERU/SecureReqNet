I'm trying to use Gitlab to mirror my company git server to provide a web GUI. It's easy to do that by

    # git clone --mirror <repo_url>

in to repositories folder and import as bare repository 

    # bundle exec rake gitlab:import:repos RAILS_ENV=production

then sync with remote repository by

    # git remote upate

But now I'm facing a problem that I can't see the push event in time line contained in each update. I hope this can be a feature to regenerate push event from remote repository, then the mirror function is completed. Or is there any suggestion or trick that I can do this job?

Thank you
