Properly set "identity" in query metrics.


This patch adds an "identity" field to QueryPlus and sets it in
QueryLifecycle when the query starts executing. This is important
because it allows it to be used for future QueryMetrics created
by that QueryPlus object.
We also add "identity" to the request-level QueryMetrics object
created in emitLogsAndMetrics.
