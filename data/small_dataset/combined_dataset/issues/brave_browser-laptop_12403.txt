Update webtorrent-remote to 2.1.0


Fix #12400 using dcposch/webtorrent-remote#8
Test Plan:

go to a torrent file, ex: https://zooqle.com/download/wiv7v.torrent.
after webtorrent opens, open page devtools and inspect a 'save file' icon to see the port number of the href attribute. ex: if the href is 'http://localhost:39292/0', the port is 39292.
use ifconfig or go to https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/ to find your private IP address
open a new tab and visit http://$PRIVATE_IP:$PORT where PRIVATE_IP is the IP from Step 3 and PORT is the port from step 2. nothing should happen.
