Vulnerability Warning Tracking Issue


Two project-level development only packages currently produce vulnerability warnings upon package install of a new project.


 Protractor (1 warning) -- dependency webdriver-js-extender uses an outdated version of selenium-webdriver (UPDATE: Protractor 4.5.0 has been released with a fix)


 Karma (2.0: 6 warnings) -- dependency log4js uses an outdated version of loggly.  Note also that log4js (and as a result karma) produce the following deprecated package warnings upon install:
