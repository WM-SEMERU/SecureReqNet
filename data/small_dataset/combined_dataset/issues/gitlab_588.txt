See the issue in attached image. I've been having this issue since (more or less) version 6.5, and now it still exists in version 7.2.1. My OS is CentOS 6.5 and environment is as follows.

```
    [deprecated] I18n.enforce_available_locales will default to true in the future. 
    If you really want to skip validation of your locale you can set 
    I18n.enforce_available_locales = false to avoid this message.

I see similar issues but they are all marked as resolved, but I still have this problem.
