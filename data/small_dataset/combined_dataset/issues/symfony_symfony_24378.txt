From @Pierstoval on Slack:

Hey, guys, I learnt a few days ago that if you don't specify a user provider in a firewall configuration, the security will use the first one in the list. Don't anyone think specifying the user provider should be mandatory ? Or at least mandatory if we have more than one provider registered?
