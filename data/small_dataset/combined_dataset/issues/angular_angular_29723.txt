What is the current behavior?
NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR is typed ControlValueAccessor. This conflicts with it being used as multi: true when injecting it programmatically through Injector#get as the function is typed to return a single ControlValueAccessor, even though it should be an array of them.
Issue Number: #29351
What is the new behavior?
The injection token is now typed ControlValueAccessor[].
Does this PR introduce a breaking change?

 Yes
 No

Other information
I have not added any tests for this as it's purely a type information. This cannot be tested in an assertion kind of test, the only possibility would be a nop Injector#get call and making sure the TS compiler doesn't complain. This isn't a functional test, though, and I doubt we generally test that types are correct, so it seems unnecessary.
