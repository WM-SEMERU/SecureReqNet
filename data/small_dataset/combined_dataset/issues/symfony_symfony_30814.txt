Hi!
As pointed out in #30805, the PhpSerializer creates strings with null bytes. This apparently causes problems on at least some database systems (I didn't notice, but @vincenttouzet did). I also read that, for example, SQS doesn't like null characters. And, in general, because we're sending this data over a transport, base64_encoding data is pretty standard.
Does anyone see any downsides?
Cheers!
