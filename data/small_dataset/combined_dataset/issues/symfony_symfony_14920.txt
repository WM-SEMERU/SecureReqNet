[Security][Translation] duplicate translations


After updating Symfony I thought I could see the effect of #14601 but it doesn't happen because there is two translations folders into the security component.
I updated Security/Resources/translations/security.fr.xlf but Security/Core/Resources/translations/security.fr.xlf is used.
I don't know if it's legit but now that translations have diverged I think something must be done.
