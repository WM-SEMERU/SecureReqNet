add Liran Tal as group member.


I would like to nominate Liran Tal as a member of te Security WG:


Liran requested to join the ecosystem triage team and the process state that triage team members must be WG members.


Liran has published some very good security content and  a book


Since our next meeting is only next month, if @nodejs/security-wg  accepts it, I would like to have Liran becoming a member ASAP in order to have him join the ecosystem triage team.
