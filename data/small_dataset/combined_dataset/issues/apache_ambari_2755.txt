AMBARI-24745. Enable encryption of sensitive data in Ambari DB using …


…Ambari CLI	(dlysnichenko)
What changes were proposed in this pull request?
Enable encryption of sensitive data on Ambari DB using Ambari CLI. This is an update to the existing "ambari-server setup-security", option #2 - Encrypt passwords stored in ambari.properties file.
In addition to what the current script does, the following must also happen:

Change the subtitle to "Encrypt passwords managed by Ambari."
Authenticate an Ambari administrator user
Ask the user if they want to encrypt sensitive service configuration data
Add command line options for authenticating an Ambari administrator and whether sensitive service configuration data is to be encrypted
Issue a request to Ambari to encrypt sensitive data (if the user wants this)

How was this patch tested?
Unit tests are pending
Checked encryption / re-encryption on live cluster.
Decryption is not implemented yet
Encryption without persisting master key is not possible (if we need it)
