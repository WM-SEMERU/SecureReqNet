Allow extenders to access the root paths of webhook servers without redirection


What type of PR is this?
/kind feature
What this PR does / why we need it:
Enable users to set the root path of the webhook server, like http://example.com:8080, as a target of scheduler extenders in policy files.
Currently enabling/disabling extenders is switched whether {filter,prioritize,preempt,bind}Verb in the policy is empty of not. It means that when you set the values as:

"urlPrefix": "http://example.com:8080"
"filterVerb": ""

then the filter extender will be disabled.
On the other hand, when you set:

"urlPrefix": "http://example.com:8080"
"filterVerb": "/"

they result in http://example.com:8080//, and usually redirected to http://example.com:8080. But actually the net/http package the scheduler uses inside seems to redirect an original POST request as GET.
This PR makes the scheduler access to http://example.com:8080 directly when filterVerb is /.
