I've found the docblock for TokenInterface::getUser misleading. By reading it I've written something like:
$username = (string) $token->getUser();
This actually doesn't work, since UserInterface doesn't implements __toString and I have some instance of AdvancedUser (coming from InMemory provider).
If the token always return a UserInterface or string, then my fix is ok.
