[Messenger] Better error messages when transport is not supported


Description
As reported in symfony/symfony-docs#10755 when you configure an amqp transport but AMQP is not installed in your app, you see an error message.
We could improve the following code to introduce a check for the AMQP class and throw an error if it's not installed (with the usual "Try running "composer require ..." that we use in many other parts of the framework):



symfony/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/DependencyInjection/Configuration.php
