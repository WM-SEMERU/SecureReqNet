Checking my BAT payments before they were distributed, found this website (below) with 18 hr time spent this month. It's possible I went to this site at some point in the month (don't remember it), but definitely did not spend 18 hrs on it. If I left it open in a tab or something, I imagine this shouldn't count. Just wanted to put this out there.
