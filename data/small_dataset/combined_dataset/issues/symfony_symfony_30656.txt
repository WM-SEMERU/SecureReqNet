[RFC][DX][Workflow] Configuration of initial places and marking store


Description


In #30551, the marking store has been "simplified" internally, but the configuration is now more confusing (ref #30551 (review)).


In #30468, initial_place has been renamed initial_places but still supports passing one place that will be normalized to an array despite this single example in the upgrade file. Also, this naming is now a bit confusing too, whether we can use it with one place is not obvious anymore.


Proposition


Simplify the method type configuration which is the only one built-in we want to support now, and infer the single state from the type of the workflow, this leaves one argument to configure, the property name:
framework:
 workflows:
     article:
         type: state_machine # or workflow for multiple states
         marking_store:
             type: method # this line can be removed in Symfony 5.0
             property: state
Instead of inferring we can use another key: state (single or multiple) along with property,
or use a boolean as suggested by @pbowyer in the review linked above.


We could rename initial_places to something invariant like initial_marking or initial_state.
