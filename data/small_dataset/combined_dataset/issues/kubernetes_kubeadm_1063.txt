What happened?


I tried to setup HA deployment as described here.


I deployed my own Nginx on separated EC2 instance, and configured it to serve as a https load balancer.


I generated a self-signed certificate and used it inside Nginx ssl binding configuration


I copied that certificate to "master" node and added it to "trusted list" (as described here)


I verified that certificate indeed trusted by doing cUrl to the Nginx machine


When executing "kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml" the setup hangs on "[init] this might take a minute or longer if the control plane images have to be pulled" stage.


What you expected to happen?
Setup will succeed
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
Do the steps I described above (use load balancer with self-signed certificate)
Anything else we need to know?
This is what i getting from Journal logs:
