My previous attempt to fix #7104 without any BC break was quite ugly so here we are.
As said before the logout handlers are currently not invoked if the security token is null. Problem is, the firewall listeners registration order only allows ContextListener to set a token before LogoutListener. This means any stateless firewall cannot benefit from the logout option, which is quite ironic as we have a CookieClearingLogoutHandler.
None of the Symfony logout handlers use logout's $token parameter so I thought about removing it but in the meantime I just allowed it to be null in order to mitigate possible BC breaks.
I really would like this to be fixed with Symfony 4!
