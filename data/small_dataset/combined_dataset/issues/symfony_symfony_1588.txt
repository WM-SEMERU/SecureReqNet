[Security&Session] Bug: Session token is not refreshed upon change of user data


Changing user data does not reflect in the (session) token.
Use-case (reverse this for a possible security vulnerability):

Login (non-admin) user
Through some action, add ROLE_ADMIN to user, persist
Role ROLE_ADMIN prerequisite actions are unavailable until logout+login

Problem:
Role requirements are taken from session, which holds serialized state of SomeToken. SomeToken is created upon successful "login_check", being immutable afterwards (until next signin)
