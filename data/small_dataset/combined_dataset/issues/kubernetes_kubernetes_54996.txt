Reduce metadata-proxy cpu requests to 30m


After the recent change enabling metadata-proxy in tests (#54150) we started seeing problems with scheduling cluster autoscaler on master. Metadata-proxy eats all of the available space leaving nothing for CA to run on.
This PR reduces the cpu requests for metadata-proxy allowing other components to fit in.
