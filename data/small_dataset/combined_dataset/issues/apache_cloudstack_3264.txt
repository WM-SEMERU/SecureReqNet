2019-04-05 14:08:18,176 ERROR [c.c.a.ApiServer] (qtp788117692-312:ctx-6993074e ctx-97c28410) (logid:b9e936a0) unhandled exception executing api command: [Ljava.lang.String;@3ab4697e

STEPS TO REPRODUCE

As above, take volume snapshot, then delete original primary storage pool.
Confirm the snapshot has two entries in cloud.snapshot_store_ref - one for primary and one for image.
Ensure the primary pool is marked as deleted.
Do a listSnapshots API call against the snapshot and observe above errors.
Now change the snapshot_store_ref entry for primary for the snapshot in question to a non-deleted primary pool.
Do the listSnapshots API call again and observe this working.
