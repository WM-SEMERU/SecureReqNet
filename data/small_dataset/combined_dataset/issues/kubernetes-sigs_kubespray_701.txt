Add (optional) support for generating secrets and certs from Vault


By adding optional vault roles to the masters, vault can be used as a cert store. Proposed implementation would initially:

include roles to setup local vaults on the masters

use etcd as a backend
self-sign/unseal or act as an intermediate


template certs for platform components via confd

Our use-case comes from using vault in the form of an intermediate. Since we'd like to use the etcd backend, it's beneficial to include that orchestration in kargo vs. another project so we can hook it into the deployment pipeline after etcd but before k8s. There's a little inception loop we'd need to address since we want etcd secured by vault certs as well.
