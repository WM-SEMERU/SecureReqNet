A while ago we introduced DebugAccessDecisionManager to collect this information and display it in the Security panel of the Symfony Profiler. I though that Debug + ... was a better name than Traceable + .... However, every comparable class in Symfony is called Traceable + ..., so we should rename DebugAccessDecisionManager to TraceableAccessDecisionManager.
This issue is an "easy pick", so it can be solved by any developer wanting to make their first contribution to Symfony. But first, let's wait and see if the Symfony Core members agree with this proposal.
