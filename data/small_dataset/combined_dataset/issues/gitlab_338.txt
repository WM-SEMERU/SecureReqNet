I've uploaded an avatar, then I deleted the avatar again, because I wanted to revert back to Gravatar.
The result is that I currently have a broken avatar, and i can't save my profile anymore.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Have a gravatar
2. Upload a custom avatar and save profile
3. Remove avatar and save profile
4. Now you don't have an avatar anymore, and you can't save your profile.

**Expected output**

The avatar was deleted, and I returned to my gravatar avatar,
