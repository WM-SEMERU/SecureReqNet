Status of Caja Project?


Can the Caja developers comment on the state of the Caja project?  A few concerning observations are:

caja.appspot.com has been broken for awhile now and nobody seems to care / comment.
Google Apps script deprecated sandbox modes other than IFRAME, which I interpret as a move away from Caja.
Low volume of updates and attention to issues (on Github).

In any case, I think the ideas behind Caja are still great and I'd like to see it continue and grow, but I'm wondering what's happening.
Thanks in advance,
Paul
