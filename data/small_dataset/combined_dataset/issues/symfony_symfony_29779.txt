Adding exception declarations for PasswordEncoderInterface. I think it's a matter of opinion whether this change is a BC break. The BC promise doesn't cover such a case; I'd see it as a BC break to add exceptions in general, but in this case it's more of a "documentation" issue, as most implementations of the interface have been throwing those exceptions for years.
