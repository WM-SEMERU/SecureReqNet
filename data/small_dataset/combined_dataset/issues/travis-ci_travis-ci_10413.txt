Github plugin reports build is queued (forever) if .travis.yml contains parsing error


When
Here is my .travis.yml file:
dist: bionic
sudo: false
# Avoid re-downloading dependencies on every build
cache:
  yarn
  directories:
    - "$HOME/.m2/repository"
services:
  - docker
script:
  - cp .travis/settings.xml $HOME/.m2/settings.xml
  - ./mvnw --batch-mode --show-version install
branches:
  only:
    - master

The parsing error is caused by cache containing multiple entries that are not prefixed by a hyphen. When I view my job on https://travis-ci.com/ (requests tab) I see Could not parse [job id] but when I go on my Github pull request, "checks" tab I see a "Queued X minutes ago".
Expected behavior: Github plugin should report that the yml file cannot be parsed, instead of reporting the build is queued forever.
