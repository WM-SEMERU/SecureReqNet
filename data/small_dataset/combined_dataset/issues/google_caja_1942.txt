border-bottom-right-radius css rule stalls Caja's CSS lexer in Firefox 33


Original issue 1944 created by dmitry@lucidchart.com on 2014-11-18T21:36:26.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
Not sure about the version, but it's reproducible on http://http://caja.appspot.com/ (the header says Google Caja. Copyright (C) 2011, Google Inc. Rev 5687 built on 2014-06-05 12:03:11).
Also, it's currently happening in Google Apps Script.
See: https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=4506
OS and browser: Confirmed in Firefox 33 on Windows and Linux
What steps will reproduce the problem?
> If I loaded the playground in Chrome and pasted in "<style>h1{background-color:gray;border-bottom-right-radius:10px;}</style><h1>Hello, World</h1>â€‹", then pressing Cajole rendered the page properly.
>If I loaded the playground in Firefox 33.1 and followed the same steps, I got the unresponsive script error.
