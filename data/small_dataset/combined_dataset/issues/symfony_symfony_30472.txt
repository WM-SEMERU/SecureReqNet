Here's our use case this patch solves:
We have 2 translation files. One is created by developer and has empty <target>. Second one is created by translator and has non-empty <target>, but same <source>.
Now, unlike Symfony fixtures, we also use resname= XLIFF1 attribute. This allows us to detect when translation is out of date, which happens when <source> in dev translation is changed, but resname= is not. As visualization which better illustrates problem:
dev.xlf:
<trans-unit id="source_is_different" resname="source_is_different">
    <source>Welcome to Calida</source>
</trans-unit>
real.xlf:
<trans-unit id="source_is_different" resname="source_is_different">
    <source>Welcome to Jacqueline</source>
    <target>Willkommen bei Jacqueline</target>
</trans-unit>
We need to be able to tell <source> for this pair is different (so we prepend alert glyph to translation message, to alert developer something is wrong). In current XliffFileLoader there is no way for consumer to figure out if translation key came from resname or <source>, so we had to copy whole loader.
