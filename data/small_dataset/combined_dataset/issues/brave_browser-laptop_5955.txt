Adding and managing client certificates (HTTPS/SSL)


It's a feature but I'd love to have a way to add my own HTTPS/SSL certificate to securely connect to privately hosted webapps. Juste like Chrome and Firefox lets you save and manage external certificates.
Maybe it's already possible, but I cant find it !
Great work anyway guys :)
