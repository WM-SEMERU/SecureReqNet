[sig-auth] question about IsRBACEnabled in the e2e testing framework


in the e2e testing framework we have an auth utility function IsRBACEnabled:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/e2e/framework/authorizer_util.go#L137
in the testing commons meeting today @timothysc proposed that we might want to refactor this utility.
a question related to this code and the e2e testing framework is - should we fail immediately when the framework starts and the cluster has no RBAC, instead of having this utility called in many locations?
