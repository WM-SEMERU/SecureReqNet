I am trying the 4.1 route Internationalization & inline route, and it works well (even combined with prefix)
But i can't translate the logout url due to the current mechanisme:
Actual logout configuration :
            logout:
                path: /logout.html
                target: /

Tehorical version with Internationalization:
            logout:	
                path:
                    fr: /compte/deconnexion.html
                    en: /account/logout.html
                target: /

but even this would not make a real solution (by the way it doesn't work cause path wait only scalar expression)
Maybe logout security configuration should be based on logout route like
            logout:
				route: security_logout
				target: index_route
