Fix create secret generic paths examples


What type of PR is this?
/kind cleanup
What this PR does / why we need it:
The example in kubectl create secret is misleading and does not work. Due to the fact that we're passing key=value pair bash does not expands ~ to user path, whereas $HOME does work. I've decided to make the path more generic like with the other examples.
Special notes for your reviewer:
/assign @mfojtik
Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
NONE
