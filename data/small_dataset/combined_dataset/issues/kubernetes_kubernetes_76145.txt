The re-watch mechanism does not work as expectations


If we have two apiservers and restart one on an upgrade, all watchers will go to the other on and never shuffle to the new one.
var (
	// We try to spread the load on apiserver by setting timeouts for
	// watch requests - it is random in [minWatchTimeout, 2*minWatchTimeout].
	minWatchTimeout = 5 * time.Minute
)

We do the re-watch in reflector actually, but the underly client will be reused.
