ContextListener (https://github.com/symfony/security/blob/master/Http/Firewall/ContextListener.php#L176) should give a reason why the token is cleaned, I think something in the session like _security.logout_reason.
So the application could handle this kind of logout more user friendly by displaying a message "You have been disconnected because you have changed your password".
Also, that could help developers to setup properly the security (by reading https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/entity_provider.html until the end ^^).
