Improve error handling for triggering function when there is a schema mismatch


Motivation
When a user is triggering a function with data that doesn't conform with the schema of the function's input topic, the error returned is not very helpful i.e.:
Reason: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

Improve the error handling and return message for this situation
