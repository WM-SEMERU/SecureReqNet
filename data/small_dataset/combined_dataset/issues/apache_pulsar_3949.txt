[issue 3939] [pulsar-flink]: Allow client authentication from pulsar-flink package


Problem:
pulsar-flink module (aka flink connector) internally uses pulsar-client. Though the pulsar client allows setting tokens in the client builder, the flink connector does not provide a way to pass authentication token to the pulsar client it uses internally.
Solution:
Accept authentication information as an input in pulsar-flink module. Pass this authentication information to pulsar-client.

Contribution Checklist
Fixes #3939
Motivation
We recently enabled JWT based authentication on our brokers. Though the native pulsar client allows setting tokens in the client builder, the pulsar-flink connector does not provide a way to pass authentication token to the pulsar client initialised internally.
Modifications
pulsar-flink takes auth argument and passes it to pulsar client, set new AuthenticationDisabled() to disable.
