Copy-paste on possible when the table is editable


As originally mentioned in #75 (comment).

At the moment, copying from browser only seem to work when the table is editable.
As an example, I tried to copy the content of the cell "New Mexico" on the simple table at https://dash.plot.ly/datatable/, and nothing gets copied in the clipboard.
