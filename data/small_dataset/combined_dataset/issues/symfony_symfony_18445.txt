[Symfony 2.8] A fatal error occurs when remove my User class file


configuration:
    # security.yml
    providers:
        my_user:
            id: some_service_id

    # service.yml
    some_service_id:
        class: MyUserClass
I sign in with an account and remove the MyUserClass file, then an error occurs:
Catchable Fatal Error: Object of class __PHP_Incomplete_Class could not be converted to string

Sorry for my bad english.
