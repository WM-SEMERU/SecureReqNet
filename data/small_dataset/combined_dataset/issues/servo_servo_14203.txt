OpenSSL1.1.0


I am using Debian Sid which now comes with OpenSSL 1.1.0. In this version makes many breaking changes to the API which caused the build to fail. To get things to work, I needed to run:
apt-get install libssl1.0-dev

This forces my system to use the old OpenSSL version.
When I look at Cargo.lock in components/servo, I see we are using the rust crate
openssl 0.7.14 (registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index)

The latest version (as of this writing) is 0.9.1 which builds with OpenSSL1.1.0
The problem though is that many other packages like hyper and cookie depend on the old crate for rust openssl so upgrading is not straight forward.
So is there any plan to upgrade to the latest OpenSSL?
