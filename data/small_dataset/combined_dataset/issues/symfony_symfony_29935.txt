Sidenote: I originally included the fix in #29897, but I decided to close the previous PR and divide it into two separate PRs for clarity.
Description:
With this fix, the message regarding an unused bind will have a clear information about the type of the bind (defined under _defaults, _instanceof or per service), as well as the name of the file, in which it was configurated. It's for, both, YAML and XML configurations.
For the core team, please note, that the fix assumes a possibility of definings binds under _instanceof, which was introduced in #27806. But since fixes are merged into other branches, I thought that it might be necessary to inlude this possibility. If this case requires making separate fixes for different branches, I will gladly do it.
