CSS sanitizing drops style following an extra semi-colon


When sanitizing CSS, if you give it this string of CSS
color:#292f33;;font-size:28px;padding:0px;
The result will be
color:#292f33 ; padding:0px ;
Which is missing the font-size style entirely. However, if the extra semi-colon after the color style is removed, then font-size is preserved.
