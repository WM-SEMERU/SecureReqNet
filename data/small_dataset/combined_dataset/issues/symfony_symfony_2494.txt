[SecurityBundle] Role prefix with a dedicated Role class


As i said in the title of the issue I'm using the SecurityBundle with a dedicated Role class.
And as it said in the documentation:

All roles must begin with the ROLE_ prefix to be managed by Symfony2. If you define your own roles with a dedicated Role class (more advanced), don't use the ROLE_ prefix.

But if the Role i defined aren't prefixed by ROLE_ they aren't used because of the restriction.
The restriction is made in the class \Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\Voter\RoleVoter and as you can see they're nothing that reference the fact that a dedicated Role class is used and also the prefix doesn't have to be used.
Maybe I forgot to configure something, it will be very convenient if so, or maybe the documentation for this part is not up-to-date, and it's too bad that we can't use Role without this prefix even with a dedicated class.
