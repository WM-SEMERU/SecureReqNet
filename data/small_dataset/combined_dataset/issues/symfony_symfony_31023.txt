This fixes #30996 and makes URL generation in the CLI context behave the same as it does in the web context where the LocaleListener sets the default locale (to the router context).
The Travis CI failure is related to the fact that the constraint for symfony/routing should be bumped to ^4.2.6 in the composer.json of the FrameworkBundle (when it gets tagged).
