All URLs should be enforced to HTTPS


Currently we don't enforce HTTPS URLs in the edit form, and we end up with a bad report regarding our secure connection:

(typically due to images served over HTTP)
We should enforce HTTPS to prevent that.
BTW, we should also enforce using godotengine.org/asset-library over HTTPS, at least when accessing the login interface.
