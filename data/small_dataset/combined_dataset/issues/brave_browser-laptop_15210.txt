Add preparation for upcoming Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish and other cleanups of the apt install


This PR removes all the old Ubuntu releases that are unmaintained and don't get any security updates, adds support for Ubuntu Cosmic and organizes the list a bit better. Brave had a rocky start when 18.04 was released so this should hopefully make Brave work on the new version from day one!
