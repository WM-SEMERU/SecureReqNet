I'd like we discuss adding a toArray() method to ResponseInterface.
JSON responses are so common when doing server-side requests that this may help remove boilerplate - especially the logic dealing with errors.
WDYT?
(about flags, I don't think we should make them configurable: if one really needs to deal with custom flags, there's always ResponseInterface::getContent() - but it should be very rare.).
