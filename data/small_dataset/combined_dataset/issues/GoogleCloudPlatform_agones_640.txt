Remove serviceaccount for game server container


This mounts an emptydir over the service account token that is automatically mounted in the container that runs the game server binary.
Since this is exposed to the outside world, removing the serviceaccount token removes authentication against the rest of the Kubernetes cluster if it ever gets compromised.
Closes #150
