fix(api): remove `sanitize` call on reducing stories to groups


Issue: #6128
DISCLAIMER: it's not fix, it's my opinion for fix that issue
What I did
I removed sanitize. It's excess filter.
I dont see problem when user calls he story with using special chars.
About @tuchk4 issue:
If story name Vue <docs/> and not set 'hierarchySeparator', 'hierarchySeparator' fallback to '/' and story split to group and then compat 'storyname'. Eg: 'a/b' -> a--b. In your case, last '>' symbol removed after sanitizing and story child has been equal to the story parent. It's throwing the recursive error.
I hope I described the error correctly. Feel free to correct me.
How to test
Check that I didn't have broken any stories cases.
