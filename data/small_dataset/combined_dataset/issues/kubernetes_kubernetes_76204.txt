[sig-apimachinery] removal of an aggregated client from the e2e test framework


please mind that this is more of a question/proposal.
in the e2e testing framework we import an aggregated clientset from here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/e2e/framework/framework.go#L49
the only consumer of this client is this conformance test:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/e2e/apimachinery/aggregator.go#L80

Should be able to support the 1.10 Sample API Server using the current Aggregator

the k8s testing commons group discussed if this client should be removed from the framework, possibly moved inside this test only.
PR in flight (needs changes):
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75989/files
questions:

is this test up to date and maintained?
any objections to creating the client in the test instead of the framework?
