Change IsAjaxRequest in IsApiRequest in CookieAuthenticationEvents


It would be ideal to have a way of overwriting the IsAjaxRequest method in order to cover API only implementations
Describe the solution you'd like
I would propose renaming IsAjaxRequest into IsApiRequest and use the same function body as we currently have.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Overwriting each event individually.
