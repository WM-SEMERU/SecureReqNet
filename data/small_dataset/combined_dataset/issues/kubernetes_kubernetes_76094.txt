`make verify WHAT=bogus` succeeds


Found while working on #74877
As part of switching from godep to go modules, I renamed the verify-godeps.sh script to verify-vendor.sh
CI was green, so I assumed all was well, until I realized that CI was actually calling make verify WHAT=godeps, and make verify passes if the WHAT target cannot be located.
make verify should fail if an unknown target is specified, or jobs that think they are testing things could have typos or be testing nonexistent verify scripts.
