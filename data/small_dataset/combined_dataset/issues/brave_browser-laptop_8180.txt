Describe the issue you encountered:
When attempting to use LastPass in a private tab, the credentials available in the context menu are those from the most recently visited non-private tab.


Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?): Windows 10


Brave Version (revision SHA): 10539c2


Steps to reproduce:

Navigate in a public tab to a site that uses LastPass credentials
Navigate in a private tab to another site, and check LastPass in context menu
LastPass will offer the credentials for the public site



Actual result:
Our context menus are confused about which site the user is on.


Expected result:
Our context menus are aware of where the user is, and will not offer credentials for any other domain.
