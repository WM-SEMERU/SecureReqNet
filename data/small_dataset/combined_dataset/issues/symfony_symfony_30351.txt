On any kind of multi loads, including tags loading where it's always the case, current code leads to an explosion of Redis lookups affecting performance on RedisCluster (as it does not support pipeline).
This backports the code for mget() usage from 4.x in order to fix it.
It's done with one small improvment which would also be relevant for 4.x, only using pipeline on cluster on predis as mget is more efficient (ref redis doc).
