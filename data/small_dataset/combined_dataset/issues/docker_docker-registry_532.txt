Pulling a private image without logging in returns a 404 instead of a 401


If a user attempts to pull a private image when the user is either not logged in or does not have credentials the user is returned
Pulling repository foo/bar
2014/08/21 11:30:39 HTTP code: 404

It may be a security concern to return a 401 but in general that's how HTTP conveys permission denied errors.
