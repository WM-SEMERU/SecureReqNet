Improve now what sentence


The "Now What?" section means 2 things:

Tell the developers that the component is ready.
Tell the developers to go through a specific documentation.

Therefore, I think it should be separated into two sentences for readable reason. By the way, I just remove unnecessary word "that" and add a comma.
