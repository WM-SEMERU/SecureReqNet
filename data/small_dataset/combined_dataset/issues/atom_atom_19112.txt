Web browser


So Atom is secretly a web browser, the interface of Atom is inside index.html, except for the menu-bar. If you press Ctrl+â‡§ Shift+I you can open the web console. If you switch to the console tab, and type open("https://www.example.com/"): Atom will open another window that redirects to https://www.example.com/!
