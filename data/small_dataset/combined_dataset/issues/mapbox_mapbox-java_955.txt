Directions Refresh new implementation


This PR creates the infrastructure to allow updating routes with updated annotations via the directions-refresh endpoint (This endpoint is currently only on staging). Included in this PR:


A directions request can contain a new boolean parameter enable_refresh. If this parameter is set to true, the route will be cached and will be refreshable via the directions-refresh endpoint.


The directions-refresh request needs to include the route_id, route_index, leg_index, access_token, and whatever annotations needed.


The directions-refresh response is basically a barebones DirectionsRoute, which only includes a list of barebones RouteLegs, which only include the requested LegAnnotations.


Todo:

 Add enable_refresh option to directions API
 Create DirectionsRefresh service module
 Create sample test
 Create unit test
 Add javadoc
