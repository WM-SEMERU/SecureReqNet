Potential attack vector through npx?


I'm opening this issue because:

 npm is crashing.
 npm is producing an incorrect install.
 npm is doing something I don't understand.
 Other:

I just read this article about npm@5.2.0 and npx.
if I understand correctly, using eg npx create-react-app my-project will install create-react-app, execute it, and uninstall it, once it's finished.
Isn't this a potential attack vector? If somebody created a package like create-recat-app (note the typo), people mistyping dependencies might download malicious programs that are then immediately executed. Especially beginners might even enter sudo credentials, if a program asks for them.
I'm not sure this is actually a problem, just something that came to mind. But maybe you already thought of this.
