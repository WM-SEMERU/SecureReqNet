BroadcastDistributionRules to load segments on whole tiers rather than making server-by-server decisions


Broadcast rules which load segments on servers with colocated data sources (server-by-server decision) are very hard or impossible to implement correctly. I think the problems of non-atomic moves during balancing are underestimated.
When rules are loaded from the metadata store, Coordinator can figure out load rules for data sources and maps them to "colocated data sources", obtaining a list of tiers on which broadcasted segments should be effectively loaded. Then it loads broadcasted segments on all servers in the needed tiers, as described here: #4077 (comment)
