SES HTML logger does not report stack on IE 11


Original issue 1877 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-12-19T22:02:56.000Z:
In explicit.html, execute ses.logger.error('boo', new Error('boom')).
On Chrome, this will include a toggle for displaying the traceback of the error. On IE 11, it does not.
I have not looked at whether this is a UI bug or a lack of getStack functionality.
