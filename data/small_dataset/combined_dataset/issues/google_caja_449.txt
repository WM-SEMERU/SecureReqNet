Consider wrapping/virtualizing Date zero-arg constructor


Original issue 449 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-10T01:20:29.000Z:
Consider providing a wrapper for the Date constructor so that the zero-arg
constructor does not provide access to the current date, while the n-arg
constructors (for n>0) still work just as before.  MarkM thinks he has a
clever scheme so that "instanceof" will continue to work and Caja code
won't be able to tell that Date has been wrapped (i.e., it has been
successfully virtualized).
