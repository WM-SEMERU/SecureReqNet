Allow "," in element id


This is a minimal fix to allow "," in the element id.
Caja probably needs a story with a more comprehensive change, as it's already more permissive than then HTML4 specification.
HTML 4.01 specified that ID tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens (-), underscores (_), colons (:), and periods (.).

HTML5 got rid of those restrictions on the id attribute. Now class and id attributes are now very similar.  The only requirements left — apart from being unique in the document — are that the value must contain at least one character (can’t be empty), and that it can’t contain any space characters.
