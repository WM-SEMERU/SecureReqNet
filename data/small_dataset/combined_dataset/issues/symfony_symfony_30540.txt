[Messenger] Making it Shine


Messenger is great. But, we've only carried it 90% of the way. It's missing key features and key things to really make it as usable as it deserves to be. Similar to #30502, I'd like to ask for help & ideas from the community to really make it shine.
(Note: in some of these cases, we just need more review & testing to help push PR's forward).

 #30970 Handling & Tracking Failed Messages Support
 #30917 redis adapter
 #30957 Remove base64_encode from PhpSerializer
 #30958 Allows to register handlers on a specific transport
 Validate transport options with OptionsResolver
 Some sort of decent dashboard (or integration) to get stats about the health of your queues
 Some support, docs, something, for spinning up multiple workers, restarting them, etc
 Allow 3rd parties to define virtual transports and the user them maps to real transports
 Review pending doc PRs
 Review pending doc issues
 #30558 (and #29950 #28772) Transport Configuration & priority support (and retry attempts, etc)

 #30008 multiple queues & routing key support for AMQP + routing key Envelope

 #30670 make sure bus service ids are consistent
 #30707 Adding argument to MessageBus::dispatch() for envelopes

 #30676 dispatch send event not on retry
 #30708 Move receive loop into Worker and allow supporting multiple transports

 #30764 log error when messages fail on Worker
 #30650 Allow stamping messages dispatched by 3rd parties via events
 #30631 sent received messages to the correct bus automatically
 #30634 Possibly allow each handler of a message to be sent to a different transport (e.g. 1 handler async, 1 sync) and when received, only the 1 handler is executed.
 #29476 Command to setup transports
 #28849 Doctrine transaction support
 #30671 amqp prefetch

What else?
