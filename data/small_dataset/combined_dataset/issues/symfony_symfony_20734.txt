Issue is easy to reproduce with test giving negative data set.
0 should not pass as supported attribute for any set of attributes but it does as in_array in the method does not use flag 'strict' set to true.
As this is abstract voter and is used by users with their code flag 'strict' should be set to true.
Since is there in 2.7 and 2.8 (LTS) IMHO it should be fixed.
