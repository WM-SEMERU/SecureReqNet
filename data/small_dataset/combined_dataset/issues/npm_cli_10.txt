Add npm audit resolve command


Add means for a human to resolve issues if they can't be fixed and interactively make decisions about each issue.
See https://npm.community/t/interactive-tool-to-manage-audit-findings-npm-audit-resolve/197
I'm still hoping to discuss this, as I assume I'm not aware of all npm-cli features and modes of operation.
TODO:

 (partially done) add handling of npm configuration like prefix that I don't know how to do as of now
 make npm audit use the audit-resolv.json if present
 fix node6 support (a dependency is using ... syntax)
