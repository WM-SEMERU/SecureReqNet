Added a guide for Symfony Docs maintainers


This is for maintainers of this repo, so it doesn't have interest for normal Symfony users.
@OskarStark as the newest doc maintainer, this guide is mainly for you. When you have some time, please read it and report any problem or confusing explanation.
@xabbuh @wouterj @HeahDude as expert maintainers, please check if I missed something important about merging PRs. Two comments:

I want to add more things in the future different from merging PRs.
I prefer to show comprehensive and basic Git commands for all tasks. If the maintainer is a git expert, they can improve the commands to fit their expertise :)
