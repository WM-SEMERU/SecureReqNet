Currently, when the search box is given focus, the annoying browser outline is also added, which looks out of place (at best) in the GitLab design. A simple addition of `outline:none;` on `input#search.search-input.ui-autocomplete-input` solves this and tests out okay using the dev tools of Safari 8.0 and Chrome. Firefox does not seem to apply the outline in the first place.

I'll attempt to find the files that need to be edited, but I'm not terribly familiar with the codebase at the moment.
