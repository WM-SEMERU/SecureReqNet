When more than one user provider is configured, and remember_me is enabled on a firewall, this avoids the deprecation notice in 3.4 and thrown InvalidConfigurationException in 4.0 ("Not configuring explicitly the provider for the "remember_me" listener on "foo" firewall is ambiguous as there is more than one registered provider.").  The RememberMeFactory ignores the $userProvider argument and uses the secret configured for the firewall.  (If no secret is configured, it throws its own exception.)
The added test passes in 3.4 with a deprecation notice without the change, so would expect it to fail in 4.0 without the change.
Other tests in the SecurityBundle already included two errors and one failure, not related to this change.
