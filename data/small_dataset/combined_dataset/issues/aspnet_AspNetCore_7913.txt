Adding flexibility for the authority and audience to support Azure AD v2.0


Adding flexibility for the authority and audience  (to enable the Azurâ€¦e AD v2.0 endpoint)
Summary of the changes (Less than 80 chars)

Improving the XML comments for AzureADOptions (to help for Azure AD v2.0 and sovereign cloud support)
Adding the notion of Authority which is now computed from the Instance and ClientId, so that AzureAD v2.0 can be supported (Authority would therefore be https://{Instance}/{TenantId}/v2.0)
Adding the notion of Audience for Web APIs so that it can be set (for instance to api://{tenantId} in v2.0)

Addresses requests for supporting Azure AD v2.0 (Microsoft identity platform for developers)
This is similar to aspnet/AADIntegration#49, but without breaking changes. This will enable supporting Azure AD v2.0 naturally (from the templates)
