[SecurityBundle] Skip tests that are known to hang


Bug fix: yes
Feature addition: no
Backwards compatibility break: no
Symfony2 tests pass: yes
Fixes the following tickets: #2287
After finding the cause of the hanging tests on Windows (thanks!), @beberlei skipped one of the hanging tests from #2287 in #2478. This one fixes the other two so that #2287 can be closed.
