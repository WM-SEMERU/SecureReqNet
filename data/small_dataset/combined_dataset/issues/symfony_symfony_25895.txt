I am currently migrate a SF3.4 application to SF4.0. The only part which is still broken are our tests. When I run phpunit then I get this error:
Symfony\Component\Config\Definition\Exception\InvalidConfigurationException: Not configuring explicitly the provider for the "remember_me" listener on "main" firewall is ambiguous as there is more than one registered provider.
Can not find anything a provider config-option for the remember_me section in the last docs.
The affected test is a controller-test. This is our config/packages/test/security.yaml
security:

    encoders:
        Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User: plaintext

    providers:
        in_memory:
            memory:
                users:
                    test-user:
                        password: '8*zYKR)tBYyaN}qd'
                        roles: 'ROLE_USER'

    firewalls:
        main:
            http_basic:
                provider: in_memory
