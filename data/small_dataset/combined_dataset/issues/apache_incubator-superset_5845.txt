[READY] [feature] Added dashboard read only with new Rho role


I needed a user who could only access the read-only dashboards, so I've added a new built-in role Rho (œÅ) as logged user but less powerful than Gamma.
As Gamma user this role need a complementary role to have access to view the dashboards.
