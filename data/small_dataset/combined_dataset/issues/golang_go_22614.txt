crypto/rand: warn about very slow (60-second) /dev/urandom reads


What version of Go are you using (go version)?
go version go1.9.2 linux/amd64
Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
Yes
What operating system and processor architecture are you using (go env)?
This issue shows itself on linux/arm
What did you do?
Compile this program and run it on a linux/arm server.
What did you expect to see?
If it works it should produce output similar to this
go version devel +0ba4eba864 Mon Nov 6 08:37:30 2017 +0000
Status: 401: 401 Unauthorized
Body:
{
  "code": "missing_auth_token",
  "message": "Missing authorization token",
  "status": 401
}

What did you see instead?
However when compiled with go1.9 or go-tip it hangs indefinitely on some ARM servers.  It works fine with go-1.8.
This issue came up as part of ncw/rclone#1794
I haven't managed to replicate the hang on my raspberry Pi 3, but both @HptmHavoc and @freespace have on scaleway arm servers using different kernels.
I'm not 100% sure what is going on but it is clearly a regression.

Mine is a scaleway arm server.

Here pretty much the same, also a scaleway arm server.
