Use cases:

#30293
Transport A will be consumed by your Symfony app (so native php serialization is cool) but transport B will be consumed by another app, so you want to serialize as JSON
Upgrading from Symfony 4.2 to 4.3. The change to the PhpSerialize means that messages that were sent to the queue on 4.2, will fail on 4.3. The solution is to use the old serializer in your config. This would allow you to make your existing transport use the old serializer, then migrate to a new transport using the new serializer (then remove the old one later).

Thanks!
