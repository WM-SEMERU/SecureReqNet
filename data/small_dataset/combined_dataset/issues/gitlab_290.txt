When a users adds a deploy key to a project that I have no access to and I later need to add this deploy key to one of my repos I get

    Key has already been taken
    Fingerprint has already been taken

However, I can't select the existing deploy key. We tried to resolve this by deleting the original repo, but the error persists.
