Fixed Auth with v2 protocol


Motivation
BK auth framework is currently broken when using v2 protocol.
Changes

Fixed auth when using V2 protocol
Made sure a client with authentication enabled can talk to a bookie without authentication. This is required in any case when enabling/disabling authentication on a live cluster.
Run all auth tests against both v2 and v3 protocol.

This should be included in 4.7.2 to give a path to upgrade.
