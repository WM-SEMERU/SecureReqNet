[Serializer] Serialization versioning


Description
Sometimes we need to have a version control on the properties which are serialized.
Currently the Symfony Serializer don't provide a simple and scalable way to do it.
Example
As JmsSerializer do, it would be great to provide two annotations @Since and @Until who require the version as value (cf. example below):
class User
{
    /**
     * @Since("1.1.0")
     */
     private $email;
     
     /**
     * @Until("1.0.x")
     */
     private $username;
 }

Of course xml and yaml mappings need to support it too.
The version to compare to might be passed via the serializer context
$serializer->serialize($myObject, 'json', ['version' => '1.1.0']);
The version numbers must be in the standardized PHP version format to make it compatible with the version_compare function (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.version-compare.php)
Example of results:



Version
