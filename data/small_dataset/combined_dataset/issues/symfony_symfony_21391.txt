Guard is the new way to do authentication, and it does the job really well. But unlike, "old school" AuthenticationListeners, you can't configure the user provider to be used.
Should we allow to configure the userProvider per authenticator with something like this:
security:
    firewall:
        main:
            guard:
                authenticators:
                    - authenticator.which.use.firewall.user.provider
                    - service: authenticator.which.use.own.provider
                      provider: authenticator.own.provider
or should we just inject the right provider in the authenticator constructor and ignore the $userProvider argument in GuardAuthenticatorInterface::getUser method? The latter looks bad for DX as the developer will have to ignore this provided argument and won't be able to use a framework configured provider as he need to inject it in the authenticator constructor.
