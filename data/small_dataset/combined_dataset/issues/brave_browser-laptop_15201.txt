Always re-creates ~/Downloads folder, no matter which download setting is chosen


Description
Brave browser always defaults to the standard download folder no matter what setting I choose in the browser settings. This bug has been described in the community forum since 2017 but with no repair or even reaction, so I post it here as well, hoping for it to be seen.
Steps to Reproduce

Download a file (ensure “Always ask me where to save files” is true)
Save it to ~/tmp/brave/a/b/c/
Delete the a folder like rm -rf ~/tmp/brave/a
Click a link to download a new file

Actual result:
Brave recreates ~/tmp/brave/a/b/c/.
NOTE: You just click to download, you don’t actually need to save the new file. As soon as the “save file as” box has opened, the folder hierarchy has been recreated.
Expected result:
You should be prompted to download the file in either ~/tmp/brave or ~/Downloads.
Reproduces how often:
Every time.
