$guardHandler->authenticateUserAndHandleSuccess()  not working


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.1
Description
This is not working as expected. The user is redirected to the login form, not to the restricted area:
$guardHandler->authenticateUserAndHandleSuccess($singer, $request, $authenticator, 'singer_firewall');
However, if I do it "manually", it works as expected (i.e. user redirected to restricted area):
$token = new UsernamePasswordToken($singer, null, 'singer_firewall', $singer->getRoles());
$tokenStorage->setToken($token);
$session = $request->getSession();
$session->set('_security_singer_firewall', serialize($token));
$event = new \Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Event\InteractiveLoginEvent($request, $token);
$eventDispatcher->dispatch("security.interactive_login", $event);
return $this->redirectToRoute('singer_profile', array('singerId'=>$singer->getId()));
That's why I'm positive that my config is correct ;-)
Wasn't authenticateUserAndHandleSuccess() meant to be a "shortcut" for this?
Additional context

I have multiple firewalls.
My onAuthenticationSuccess() returns a RedirectResponse (basically the same as above).
If I die; in onAuthenticationSuccess(), Symfony's debug toolbar shows me that I am authenticated. However, there's no "Firewall name" shown in the popup.
