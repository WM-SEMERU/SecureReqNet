Undescore in property name cannot be normalized


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.2
Description
I've added property with underscore in the name and after normalization the property was not there.
How to reproduce
make:entity
add new property with underscore, for example: "sender_collapse"
try to normalize it
Possible Solution
I've found, that in vendor\symfony\property-info\Extractor\ReflectionExtractor.php method getAccessorMethod checks if there is method in entity class that is called as property name with underscore (for example getSender_collapse()) which I didn't have, because make:entity command generates methods without underscores.
Of course symfony recommends to use camelCase for variables, functions, methods, but I haven't found to written explicitly I had to use camelCase for entity properties as well.
I've changed my entity properties to camelCase and it worked.
I think there should be either warning while trying to add property with underscore make:entity or generating scheme with doctrine or a fix for generating proper property names for ReflectionExtractor class.
