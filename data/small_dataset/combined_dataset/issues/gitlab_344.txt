Trying to open an issue on an empty repository (no code uploaded), I get a 500 error each time I try to view this specific issue. The body of the issue does not make any explicit reference on a commit hash but I think regex parsing assumes there is one and crashes at the end. The problem is verified in my gitlab installation and gitlab.com.

The log produced in my gitlab installation (6.9):
```

The body of the issue that is sufficient to reproduce this bug, even on gitlab.com ( [check it here](https://gitlab.com/sque/empty-project/issues/1) )

```

I suppose that code tries to match git hashes found through markdown parsing but fails because there are no commits at all. Unfortunately I am not familiar with ruby to investigate further and provide a patch :( But I would love to see this fixed!
