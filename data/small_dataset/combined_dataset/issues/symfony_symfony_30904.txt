EUFOSSA Hackathon
As discussed with @joelwurtz this adds a new ObjectPropertyListExtractorInterface and a default implementation.
See #30818

A new interface will be provided ObjectPropertyListExtractorInterface (name can change), that allow getting attributes based on an object. A default implementation will be provided that use the PropertyListExtractorInterface and a class resolver, as the latter one only rely on class name, it may be important to have this distinction (this will allow features that rely on a specific value of the object to get the current property list, like exclusion policy)
