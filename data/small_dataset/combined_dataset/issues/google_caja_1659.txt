mitigateGotchas can throw with undefended prototypes


Original issue 1659 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-02-21T21:56:44.000Z:
Demo:
​<script>
try {
cajaVM.eval('{');
} catch (e) {
alert(Object.isFrozen(Object.getPrototypeOf(e)));
}
</script>
​This throws due to issue 1658, and since mitigateGotchas now lives in a non-SES frame, the exception has an undefended prototype chain. This access can be bootstrapped into modifying the behavior of the mitigator, and therefore rewriting all further evaluations, including any occurring in the taming frame.
Even if issue 1658 in particular, is fixed, we should defend against an unsafe exception; perhaps by having function mitigateGotchas in startSES.js catch any exception thrown and rebuild it with its own prototypes.
