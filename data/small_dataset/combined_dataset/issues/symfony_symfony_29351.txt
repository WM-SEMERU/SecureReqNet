Unrecognized options "memory_cost, time_cost, threads" under "security.encoders.Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User"


Symfony version(s) affected: during update to 4.1.8
Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior:
tried to composer update my project and I had the message : Unrecognized options "memory_cost, time_cost, threads" under "security.encoders.FOS\UserBundle\Model\UserInterface" (my security.encoders config was on FOS\UserBundle\Model\UserInterface I then changed it to Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User)
Now I have an excpetion on my app with the message  : Unrecognized options "memory_cost, time_cost, threads" under "security.encoders.Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User"
Steps to reproduce:

composer update
"global" exception on my app

Provide logs (if relevant):
During update, I got this error message
Executing script cache:clear [KO]
 [KO]
Script cache:clear returned with error code 1

Script @auto-scripts was called via post-update-cmd

I guess it's related to my password encoding config with argon2i (my config is the same as the docs)
