Scrub code for potential integer overflows


PR #690 fixed integer overflow bugs for memory allocations, which is required for SDL, but there are other places that should be fixed:

Anything with strlen(X) + Y
Any bounds checking on untrusted data: like offset + size < MAX\
Rounding functions like in utils.h.
str.h and mem.h have a lot of overflow cases.
The loader like create.c has a lot of math that can overflow.
