It's currently very hard to bring something to someone's attention. Even with mentioning (unless I am missing something).

It would be nice to at least sync merge request comments to Slack. It would be better still to alert users on slack when they are mentioned on GitLab.

Is there anything in the works to allow the notifications system to use something other than email?
