Address Bar Freezes GUI


Description
Typing into the address bar (still) results in an approximately 3-4 second full-browser freeze, sometimes giving a "brave.exe is not responding" message from Windows in the top left corner.  All GUI elements become unresponsive, and text input is occasionally lost when the browser resumes again.
Steps to Reproduce

Ensure you have imported bookmarks/passwords from Chrome and that Brave Payments are enabled.
Ensure a page is loaded.
Click on (or press alt+D) the address bar and begin typing.  (CPU usage should rise, you may hear your fan spin up.)
Watch the browser come to a complete halt for 3-4 seconds, looks like a database is freezing on lookup
Visit any new webpage to repeat steps 2 and 3.

Actual result:
Brave.exe freezes on text input to the address bar.  It cannot be closed or given inputs for 3-4 seconds afterward on a modern desktop.
Expected result:
Brave.exe does not freeze, accepts text input without issues.

Additional Information
You may need to have a webpage loaded already to generate this bug.  Brave.exe seems to freeze a lot, making it unusable as a primary browser.  Ctrl+F and text selection result in freezes as well.  The payments screen freezes almost every time I try to access it following an import of data from Chrome.  Removing all but ~25 bookmarks did not resolve any of these issues.
