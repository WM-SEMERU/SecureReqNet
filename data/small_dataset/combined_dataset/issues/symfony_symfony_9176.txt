[SecurityBundle] Add configuration aliases "csrf_token_generator" and "csrf_token_id" for "csrf_provider" and "intention"


In #6554, the names "intention" and "csrfProvider" were changed to "csrfTokenId" and "csrfTokenGenerator". This is not yet reflected in the SecurityBundle configuration, which still contains the configuration values "intention" and "csrf_provider".
Corresponding aliases "csrf_token_id" and "csrf_token_generator" should be created.
TODO

 The documentation needs to be checked for references to the configuration of the application secret. Remarks that the secret is used for CSRF protection need to be removed.
 Add aliases "csrf_token_generator" and "csrf_token_id" for "csrf_provider" and "intention" in the SecurityBundle configuration
