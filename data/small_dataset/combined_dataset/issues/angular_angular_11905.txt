feature request: Distinguish between strict and non-strict mode for DomSanitizer


[x] feature request

Current behavior
Now, DomSanitizer removes all HTML-unsafe attributes, without validate them (such as id, name...), even if they are empty value.
Expected behavior
Allow the developers to choose between strict and non-strict mode for DomSanitizer validations. Or, just check HTML-unsafe attributes on safety.
Reproduction of the problem
See plunker
Before to create this issue, I asked on stackoverflow: Angular 2: sanitizing HTML stripped some content with div id - this is bug or feature?.
As explained to me, this behavior is due to the known safety rules:

Strictly validate unsafe attributes such as background, id and name.

But in my example on plunker, HTML-unsafe attributes not check any validation. They just removed! In my example removes empty id:
<div id="">This is div with id attribute</div>
Maybe this is bug?

Angular version: 2.0.0
