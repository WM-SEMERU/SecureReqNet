While discussing the "deprecation path" of the logout_on_user_change security option with @chalasr  I got a bit confused.

on 3.4 we added the option (default=false) and triggered a deprecation in case it's false
on 4.0 the default became true and the option is no-op (does not change anything if its set to false)
on 4.1 the option is additionally also deprecated

So maybe we should change the info text of the config node to mention that its effectively no-op since 4.0. WDYT?
