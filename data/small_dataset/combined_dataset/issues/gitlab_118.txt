This is pretty subjective and probably depends on individual use. But for me, coming from GitHub, I found GitLab's landing page to be harder to navigate. Usually I bee-line straight to a recent project, but on GitLab they're squirreled to the right. Groups require switching to a sub-tab, and the tabs don't highlight to tell you which view is active.

We did a revamp of the dashboard that might be useful to someone: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9406660
