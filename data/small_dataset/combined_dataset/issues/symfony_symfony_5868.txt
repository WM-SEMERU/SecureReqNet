Logout action: SessionHandler::write(): Parent session handler is not open


Working through some tests using the bundled Security functionality, and we have noticed that on a logout action we are getting in our server logs:
[Mon Oct 29 16:43:14 2012] [error] [client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'ErrorException' with message 'Warning: SessionHandler::write(): Parent session handler is not open in /web_dir/app/cache/dev/classes.php line 558' in /web_dir/app/cache/dev/classes.php:558\nStack trace:\n#0 [internal function]: Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Debug\\ErrorHandler->handle(2, 'SessionHandler:...', '/web_dir...', 558, Array)\n#1 /web_dir/app/cache/dev/classes.php(558): SessionHandler->write('e0ua5bnj0vneq97...', '_sf2_attributes...')\n#2 [internal function]: Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Session\\Storage\\Proxy\\SessionHandlerProxy->write('e0ua5bnj0vneq97...', '_sf2_attributes...')\n#3 [internal function]: session_write_close()\n#4 {main}\n  thrown in /web_dir/app/cache/dev/classes.php on line 558

It seems this issue isn't unique to us as seen at:

We are running a centos 6 machine running PHP v5.4.7 and Apache/2.2.15.
Anyone have any suggestions as to what is causing this and how we can eliminate this message on every log out?
