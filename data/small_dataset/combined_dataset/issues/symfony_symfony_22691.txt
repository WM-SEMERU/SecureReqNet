I have recently started using the Guard component to handle formless authentication. Great addition BTW (Thanks @weaverryan).
With the traditional 'form_login', we have the option to add many routes directly under the 'firewalls' key. For example the 'default_target_path'. Using 'guard' we don't have these options. I understand that any key/value pairs can be defined under the implementing bundle, but IMO bundle configuration and firewall configurations should be separate.
Would it be possible to add the configurations, under 'guard',  for 'default_target_path', 'always_use_default_target_path', 'use_referer', 'login_path' and 'failure_path'. Then make these configurations available, as possibly a container parameter, so they can be passed into our 'GuardAuthenticator' constructor?
This will keep firewall configuration nice and tidy, and also allow for the easier development of 3rd party bundles.
