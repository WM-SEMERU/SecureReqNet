Date.prototype provides ambient global communications channel


Original issue 1362 created by erights@google.com on 2011-05-30T04:01:07.000Z:
Entering
<script>
Object.freeze(Date.prototype);
Date.prototype.setFullYear(1957);
alert(Date.prototype.getFullYear());
</script>

into the playground alerts 1957. The problem here is that the underlying browser is correctly implementing either the ES3 or ES5 spec, both of which demand that Date.prototype is a valid Date object. Of all the ES5 primordial objects, Date.prototype is the only one with mutable internal properties, which are therefore not made harmless by freezing.
ES5/3 should adopt the same solution already implemented by SES, which is to replace the built-in Date mutators with wrappers which refuse (with a TypeError) to mutate prototypical Dates.
We need to also get this corrected for the post-ES5 EcmaScript standard.
