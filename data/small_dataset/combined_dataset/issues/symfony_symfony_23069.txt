When more than one assigned role reaches the same inherited role then it's duplicated in the "Inherited roles" list.
The changes in the test case show the unexpected result before fix it:
There was 1 failure:

1) Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Tests\DataCollector\SecurityDataCollectorTest::testCollectAuthenticationTokenAndRoles with data set #4 (array('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_OPERATOR'), array('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_OPERATOR'), array('ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH'))
Failed asserting that Array &0 (
    0 => 'ROLE_USER'
    1 => 'ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH'
    2 => 'ROLE_USER'
) is identical to Array &0 (
    0 => 'ROLE_USER'
    1 => 'ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH'
)
