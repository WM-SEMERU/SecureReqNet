Doctrine cache used on symfony clear cache or assets install


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4
Description
When using doctrine cache (metadata + query), the clearCache and installAssets use the doctrine cache.
The problem is that when we remove a column of an entity, the composer install use the doctrine cache, and throw an error :

Property App\Bundle\Entity\Entity::$attribute does not exist.

So we need to clear the doctrine cache but I need my vendors to do so... Why does symfony use the doctrine cache when we clear the symfony cache... ? And also why doctrine needs doctrine cache on the installAssets command ?
How to reproduce

Install a project with doctrine cache in redis by exemple
Create an entity with attributes
Generate metadata doctrine cache of this entity
Remove an attribute of the entity
Clear cache, asset install or composer install your app

Possible Solution
Don't use doctrine cache when clearing the cache or generate assets ?
