Fix:

In getConsole_Command_MessengerStopWorkersService.php line 9:
                                                                                                      
  Attempted to load class "StopWorkersCommand" from namespace "Symfony\Component\Messenger\Command".  
  Did you forget a "use" statement for another namespace?
