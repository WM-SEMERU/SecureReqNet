THRIFT-3060: clear the offline queue when written


This PR addresses an issue in the NodeJS module where data would be sent multiple times when the socket reconnects multiple times because the offline_queue would never be emptied.
This fix clears the offline_queue when the socket reconnects and the queued data is written.
Fixes THRIFT-3060.
