This PR is a first step towards #22260 by enabling the use of anon and post_authentication as listener sorting positions, opening up extending the firewall beyond authentication. To that end, returning an authentication provider ID from SecurityFactoryInterface::create() has been made optional.
A typical use case would be creating custom authorization listeners (alternatives to using access_control while still benefiting from e.g. the exception listener).
