Node audit logging


We should have a better story about audit logging on nodes. This is a fairly broad topic that could include:

Host access (SSH, privileged pods / host volumes / etc, credential changes)
Kubelet API access
Pod access (exec / attach / portforward)
What is running on the node (both in & out of pods)

I think we should treat application (pod) audit logging as a separate topic, with the possible exception of kernel audit logs (e.g. AppArmor violations).
We should have a pluggable way to push or extract the audit logs to a remote location. I'm not sure whether this needs to be a separate system from our current logging pipeline(s) (e.g. fluentd).
API (non-kubelet) audit logging is a separate issue tracked in kubernetes/enhancements#22
