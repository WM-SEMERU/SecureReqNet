Add volume mode downgrade test: should not mount/map in <1.13


What type of PR is this?
/kind cleanup
What this PR does / why we need it: The downgrade test added in #71167 is not running, because a downgrade test from 1.13->1.12 runs the tests in the 1.12 branch, and the test was only merged to 1.13. So here I would like to merge it into the 1.12 branch.
upgrade test, the test runs and is skipped, as expected

downgrade test, the test does not exist since it's not in 1.12 branch
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-cluster-lifecycle-upgrade-skew#gce-1.13-1.12-downgrade-cluster
