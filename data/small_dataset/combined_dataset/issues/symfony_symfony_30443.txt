Translation File Generation


Hi guys,
very small bug but that took me 4 hours to find the fix. When generating the files using :
php bin/console translation:update --dump-messages --force fr
It generates the files with the extension "yml" by default.
According to : https://symfony.com/doc/current/translation.html#translation-resource-file-names-and-locations, the translation component only recognizes files with the extension "yaml".
I think this could be fixed quite easily.
Also, since your documentation recommends to use XLF, I think the script should generate the files in XLF too. Or change the documentation to mention that the default should be YAML/YML (I personally prefer YAML/YML). This would make everything consistent.
