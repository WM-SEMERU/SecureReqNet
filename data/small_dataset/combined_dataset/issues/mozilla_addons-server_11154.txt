Allow accessing reviewer and django admin add-ons page using add-on id


Admins constantly have to convert between the add-on ID (guid) and the AMO ID.
Could we add url handlers for the following urls?
/reviewers/review/<guid>
/reviewers/review-listed/<guid>
/reviewers/review-unlisted/<guid>
/reviewers/review-content/<guid>
/admin/models/addons/addon/<guid>
/admin/addon/manage/<guid>

Should we also add a handler for the public pages /firefox/addon/<guid> ?
