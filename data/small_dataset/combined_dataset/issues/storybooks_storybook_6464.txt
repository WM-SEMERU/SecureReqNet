Update addons-notes README with Vue example


Issue: #5293
What I did
README for addons-notes was missing an example for Vue. Added an example based on other addon READMEs and solution suggested by @ndelangen in the specified issue. Cleaned the README to better match other addon READMEs.
Tested the example with Storybook 5.0.6 and Storybook Addon Notes 5.0.6.
Side note: Not sure if the following line in the README is still valid:

NOTE: Documentation on master branch is for alpha version, stable release is on master
