Enhance klog to split up the log files when it grows to 1.8GiB


What happened:
klog supports "log-file" flag to specify the log file path. However, this log file doesn't support chunks. That's to say, when the size of the log file reaches 1.8GiB, the older logs are truncated. See details in PR76190.
What you expected to happen:
We want to keep all the log messages. If the log file goes too large, we expect to chunk the log file and compress the 1.8GB older logs in file kube-apiserver.log,gz..
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Cherry pick reverted PR/75624 to your master, and build/release a new gcp version;
Create a cluster from the custom version,and when the log size (kube-controller-manager, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler) reaches 1.8GiB. The older log messages will be truncated.
Anything else we need to know?:
This issue needs to be fixed at least 1 month before v1.15. Since it blocks some v1.15 release features (like rebasing images from debian/alpine to distroless heavily depends on the klog feature).
Environment:

Kubernetes version (use kubectl version): v1.14, v1.15
Cloud provider or hardware configuration: GCP
OS (e.g: cat /etc/os-release):
Kernel (e.g. uname -a):
Install tools:
