Question: ungoogled-chromium instead of vanilla chromium?


There was a conversation on Reddit about Brave being insecure because of Electron/Chromium reliance: https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/9jn3de/please_dont_recommend_use_brave/

Does the Brave team agree with these concerns or specifically address them via muon development or Brave itself?
