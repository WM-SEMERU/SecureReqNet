I've updated several Symfony apps to 3.4 beta and I'm always getting this annoying deprecation message:

It's annoying because I've never configured this option in my security.yml, so it's strange to add logout_on_user_change: true to my firewalls in order to remove this deprecation. Could we avoid this deprecation when the option is not configured explicitly?
