crypto/tls: Disable CBC Ciphers by default


Per @agl on Twitter, the only way to be safe with Go and TLS if you are worried about Lucky13-style attacks is to disable CBC mode ciphers:

Currently none of the CBC ciphers are marked with suiteDefaultOff: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/tls/cipher_suites.go#L75-L95
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

It seems wrong for Go to have insecure defaults for a class of attacks that is becoming more well documented. If there is no willingness to implement countermeasures, shouldn't the vulnerable class of ciphers be disabled by default?
