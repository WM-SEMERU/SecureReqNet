'# Process 

A former security employee handled security releases. Now this person is no longer working for GitLab, the process has to change. A few notes: 

- it can't be a security employee that handles and pushes out releases
- Ideally this process is driven and owned by product and engineering

# Documentation

Documentation for security fixes is at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-tools/blob/master/doc/security.md and there is no clear distinction between release manager and developer tasks. We should make this more clear and ideally and to https://docs.gitlab.com/ or https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/.
