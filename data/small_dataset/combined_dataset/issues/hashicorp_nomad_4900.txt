[feature] support CRL (certificate revocation list) files


Preface
Nomad is currently using two systems for securing its protocols.

ACL (which has a token revocation mechanism) controls access to data and APIs
mTLS that could work in an untrusted  #environment and even prevent other services from masquerading as Nomad agents.

Use case
We have to use nomad agents over the internet and would like to protect our communication channels. So, mTLS sounds like a very natural choice. However, some of the agents could be compromised and we would like to be able to revoke their certificates.
Supporting a revocation list could help to avoid building a system for rotation low TTL certs.
What do you think?
P. S. And Vault already has a CRL support.
