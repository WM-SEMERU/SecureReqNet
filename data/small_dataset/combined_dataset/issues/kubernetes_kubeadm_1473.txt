Invalid kube-dns to CoreDNS translation


Kube-dns now accepts service name for stubdomain and nameserver, while CoreDNS does not support this feature.
As a result, a user having service name in stubdomains/nameserver in their kube-dns ConfigMap while migrating to CoreDNS will result in an invalid CoreDNS Config, resulting in a broken k8s cluster.
