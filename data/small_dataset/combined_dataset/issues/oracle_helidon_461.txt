Security - tracing support refactoring



 when tracing is enabled, security traces usernames logged in - this should be optional (may leak information to wrong audience)
 tracing propagation has issues when security is in place - traces are disconnected probably due to wrong parent SpanContext being used
 security client extension should auto-register similar to Tracing extension
