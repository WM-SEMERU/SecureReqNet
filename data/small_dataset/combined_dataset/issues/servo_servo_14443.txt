script: Ban `FnBox<()>` and lock down the dangerous generic `no_jsmanaged_fields!` implementations.


Closes #14416.
The basic cause for that UAF was the unsafe use of FnBox<()> in the rooting protocol for the JS engine integration. This patch fixes that bug and removes all generics and existentials from the no-op tracing, as they were all dangerous. There should be no more ways to get UAF from DOM heap rooting without writing custom trace hooks.
