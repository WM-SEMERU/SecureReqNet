Alert: "Your computer has been blocked" Error #S47452D


For the second time in just two weeks, a warning pop-up opens when browsing on websites. e.g. while browsing on website frontlineshop.com suddenly the BRAVE warning pop-up opens with the message: "YOUR COMPUTER HAS BEN BLOCKED" - Error: #S47452D. i had to force quiting BRAVE in order to be able o use the browser again. does anyone know what i did wrong or how i should handle such issues?
Thanks and all the best,
