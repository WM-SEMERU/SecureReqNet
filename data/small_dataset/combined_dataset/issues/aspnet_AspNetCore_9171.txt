Razor pages in a component should support @Namespace


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I don't want generated razor.g.cs files to create a namespace that is dependent upon the directory structure containing the .razor page.
Describe the solution you'd like
I believe that an @namespace directive in a rzor page should override the generated namespace. Currently adding "@namespace xyzzy" is ignored.
Describe alternatives you've considered
