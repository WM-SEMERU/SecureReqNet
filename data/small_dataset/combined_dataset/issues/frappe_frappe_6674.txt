[Bug: Important] V11 - DocType Report Ignored User Role Permissions


Vulnerable: DocType Report Ignored User Role Permissions and DocType Permission Level.
User can access field that admin want to hide by simply change
/desk#List/Purchase%20Receipt/List to /desk#List/Purchase%20Receipt/Report
There're 2 main problem regarding this issues.

User can access report page even Report has been disable from User Role Permission.
If we disable Report from User Role Permission, all it does is remove Report button on Doctype List page.
But user can still access Report page directly from url.
ie http://localhost:8000/desk#List/Purchase%20Receipt/Report




When User is on DocType Report page doctype permission level will be ignored.
