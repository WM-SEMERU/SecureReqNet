BCryptPasswordEncoder causing redirect to login page


When I'm trying to change another user's password to something longer than 72 characters (when using Bcrypt), because of this it redirects me to the login page. Not logging me out, just redirecting.
security.INFO: An AuthenticationException was thrown; redirecting to authentication entry point. 
{"exception":"[object] (Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\BadCredentialsException(code: 0):
Invalid password. at 
/projectpath/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Encoder/BCryptPasswordEncoder.php:70)"} []

Maybe fix by throwing a different exception?
I'm using v2.8.2. But I'm guessing this happens in master too (because same line of code exists), not sure though.
