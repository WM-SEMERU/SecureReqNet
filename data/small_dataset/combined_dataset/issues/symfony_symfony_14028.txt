This supersedes #13984 (it includes it, but also includes additional refactoring).
Since length information is leaked in any case, preventing unnecessary duplication of secrets is important. Since casting will always make a copy, we only cast if absolutely necessary. Additionally, appending will create a new copy of the secret, so we avoid doing that, but instead only iterate over the minimum of the two strings.
