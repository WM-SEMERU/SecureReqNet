access_control plugin


The access_control plugin covers some common use-cases related
to providing access control to the objects stored in CDN cache.
The authentication and authorization are to be performed only by the
application (origin) using any Identity Management or Directory services.
The CDN is to be concerned only with the access approval (the
function of actually granting or rejecting access) to the objects
in its own caches based on an access token provided by the application
(origin). It is assumed that the origin will perform its own access control.
