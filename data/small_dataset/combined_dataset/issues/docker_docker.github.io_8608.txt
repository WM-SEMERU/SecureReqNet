Kubernetes is ''always'' starting in Docker Desktop for Windows 18.09.2 stable

My Kubernetes is ''always'' starting in Docker Desktop for Windows 18.09.2 stable. What's wrong with my Docker?  In one page, I found that Kubernetes is only available in Edge channel.
But in another page, the document says ''From Docker Desktop for Windows 18.02 CE Edge and 18.06 CE Stable a standalone Kubernetes server is included that runs on your Windows host, so that you can test deploying your Docker workloads on Kubernetes''.
