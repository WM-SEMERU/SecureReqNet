Tools/workflow: myvn submit should not commit private patches


Original issue 1853 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-09-04T17:30:14.000Z:
To avoid disclosure mistakes, "myvn submit" should refuse to commit to SVN if the Private flag is set. The user would then explicitly clear the Private flag before submitting.
