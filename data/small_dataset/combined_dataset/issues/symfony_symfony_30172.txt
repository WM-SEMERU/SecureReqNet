Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4
Description
The src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Resources/translations/validators.lb.xlf file is missing the following translations compared to the original English file:
<trans-unit id="84">
    <source>This value should be a multiple of {{ compared_value }}.</source>
    <target>...</target>
</trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="85">
    <source>This Business Identifier Code (BIC) is not associated with IBAN {{ iban }}.</source>
    <target>...</target>
</trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="86">
    <source>This value should be valid JSON.</source>
    <target>...</target>
</trans-unit>
Possible Solution
A Pull Request must be sent to Symfony's 3.4 branch adding the missing translations.
Don't forget to take a quick look at the existing translations to use the same tone and style in the new translations.
