Description:
Issue 301:  Need to prevent shadowing of caja.def
Because the cajoler has special exemptions for calls to caja.def, in effect
relying on it, but does not currently prohibit shadowing caja, as a result
Caja's object encapsulation is easily thwarted. Caja does not yet have any
encapsulation of protected object properties. The following code run in the
Caja testbed applet prints 3469.

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function EncapsulatedObject(o) {
  this.myO_ = o;
  this.publiclyWritableField = null;
}
var eo = new EncapsulatedObject(3469);

function attacker() {
  var caja = { def: function(sub, sup, methods) {
    return methods.opener;
  }};
  var canOpener = caja.def(attacker, Object, {
    opener: function() {
      return this.myO_;
    }
  });
  eo.publiclyWritableField = canOpener;
  return eo.publiclyWritableField();
}
attacker();  
&lt;/script&gt;

Modified rules to not apply unless caja is global in the current scope.
