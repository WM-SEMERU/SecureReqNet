This would make error handling and retrying of messages much more easier. As statet  here #27008 (comment) there is currently no way to retry a for all failed handlers if there are mutliple handlers and just some throw an exception.
Also if an Exception in an handler occurs the execution chain is disrupted and the other handlers are never invoked.
With this change it is easily possible to create an userland middleware that catches the ChainedHandlerFailedException and does some custom retry logic. If you ensure that the HandledStamps on the Envelope are preserved the message will be handled just by the failed handlers
