Weird "dirt" over a PDF file view


Description
Near the bottom of the page 278 of chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/http://www.mathematics21.org/binaries/volume-1.pdf there is something looking like dirt. I attach the image
.
I also attach a copy of the PDF file volume-1.pdf because it is sometimes updated on the server.
Actual result:
Dirt.
Expected result:
No dirt.
