Infinite redirect for authenticated users when RememberMe key is changed


If a user is authenticated with RememberMeToken and has an active session, when secret key used in RememberMeAuthenticationProvider is changed, an infinite redirect loop occurs. (It's a very rare case, but I just faced this when migrating a site to a different server, which was configured with a different secret)
When secret keys don't match, RememberMeAuthenticationProvider throws BadCredentialsException, however firewall's ExceptionListener does not remove the token from the session on this exception. It does, though, on AccountStatusException.
Not sure if it's the correct fix, but I'd change the exception thrown in RememberMeAuthenticationProvider to CredentialsExpiredException.
