[SecurityBundle] Configuration definition allows for `access_control` or `rules` key


In making some changes to symfony I noticed this line of code (see it in context):
    private function addAccessControlSection(ArrayNodeDefinition $rootNode)
    {
        $rootNode
            ->fixXmlConfig('rule', 'access_control')

According to the docs, this defines "access_control" as the plural of "rule".  Sure enough, this is a valid security.yml file:
security:
    # ... 
    rule:
        - { path: ^/, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY, ip: "127.0.0.1" }
        - { path: ^/, roles: ROLE_NO_ACCESS }

Is this purposeful?  I think that one of the following should be done:

Add a comment to explain this usage of fixXmlConfig
Add a method called defineSynonym that has the same implementation as fixXmlConfig.  This would make the usage semantically correct and help with misunderstandings like #2823 .
Delete the line (not backwards compatible)

I just noticed that the same thing happens on line 129 of that file.
As a reader of this code without having just read the docs for fixXmlConfig, I would assume that fixXmlConfig(a, b) would be equivalent to fixXmlConfig(a); fixXmlConfig(b) because the words rule and access_control have no clear relation.
I'm willing to do a pull request if you guys are interested in this.
