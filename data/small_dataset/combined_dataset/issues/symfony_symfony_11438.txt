SimplePreAuthenticatorInterface doesn't conform to docs


Using the latest release, using the SimplePreAuthenticatorInterface as per the docs, results in errors.
Issuing a return null, rather than a return new PreAuthenticatedToken, in createToken() results in a Fatal Error since the AuthenticationProviderManager::authenticate() is expecting a TokenInterface instance. The docs say we can return (filtering URL section) when authentication is not required. Throwing an exception is the only means to exit the method, but, I don't know what others think, using an Exception for this conveys the wrong intention. Also, when used in conjunction with AuthenticationFailureHandlerInterface, throwing an Exception causes the onAuthenticationFailure() method to be called.
In my instance, I'm using it to validate a captch (among other things) on the login screen. I was previously extending UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener to do this, which will cause problems if any other bundle tries to extend the same class. I obviously don't want the captcha to be validated on every page.
What would be the correct Exception to throw from createToken() when we simply don't want to authorize?
