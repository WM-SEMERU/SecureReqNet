2.7 or 2.8




2.8 introduced custom user-checkers, but 2.7 already misses the injection. Would have to check which version to add it to.

This issue is coming from symfony/symfony-docs#9338. The SimpleAuthenticationProvider does not have a user-checker, unlike all other providers (except for anonymous). This means that the developer has to manually inject a user-checker in their SimpleAuthenticatorInterface implementation. Additionally this means that the configured user-checker is not passed, which causes different behavior.
Fixing this is quite simple, make sure the factory adds it as argument in the provider and call the methods at the right now. I'd consider this a bug fix (while it's also a "new" feature). In theory it should be 100% backwards compatible, code and behavioral wise. There are 2 scenarios where I foresee an issue:

A custom user-checker was defined for this firewall, but never used (or a second custom was injected as shown by the PR in docs).
No user-checker was defined, but the user implements the AdvancedUserInterface and was never checked before

In both scenarios, making the default (or configured) user-checker function properly, could add extra checks to the authentication process, which would narrow down whether or not a user can successfully authenticate. However, I consider this a bug despite being a behavioral change.
If the developer has added the user-checker manually in the implementation, it will still be executed, this will keep working. If the same user-checker is configured in the firewall, it will still be executed, albeit at a different location, changing the flow slightly.
