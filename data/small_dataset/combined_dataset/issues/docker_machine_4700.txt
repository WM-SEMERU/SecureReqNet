AWS driver does not support multiple non default subnets


Hello,
I'm using docker-machine AWS driver to spin up EC2 machines via Gitlab Autoscaling feature (reference: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/runner_autoscale_aws/index.html).
I would like the EC2 machines to be created in one of the private subnets of the VPC I provide to docker machine. Unfortunately without specifying the subnet docker-machine will use the default subnet of a randomly selected availability zone in the chosen VPC. This won't be good for my case since the default subnet is not the one I wanted.
I have the ability to select the subnet for docker-machine but multiple subnets cannot be provided to the configuration (reference: https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/aws/).
This results in registering the gitlab-runner three times one for each availability zone.
I think my problem would have been fixed with #3740 but it was never merged to master.
Thanks,
Giulio
