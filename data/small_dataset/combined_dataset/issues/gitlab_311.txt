I have uploaded a large pdf-file (1.9MB) in the wiki-repository from one of my projects.
If I reference this file per markdown and access it, I get a corrupted pdf-file with 52771 bytes.

Steps:

* clone the wiki to local
* add the pdf-file, commit and push to the wiki-area
* in the home.md-file
   [Entwurf](Entwurf.pdf)
* if I access this pdf in browse-mode, I get only 52kb from 1.9 MB.
* if I clone the wiki-repo again, I get the correct file
