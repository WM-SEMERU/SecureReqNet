Use pluginMgr.FindXXXPluginBySpec in GenerateXXXFunc in volume/operation_generator


What would you like to be added:
This change is to use PluginManager.FindXXXPluginBySpec where appropriate:

To be consistent
To allow API to apply plugin filter automatically (i.e. CanAttach, CanDeviceMount, etc).

Example:



kubernetes/pkg/volume/util/operationexecutor/operation_generator.go


         Line 864
      in
      46c8b07






 og.volumePluginMgr.FindDeviceMountablePluginByName(pluginName) 





Why is this needed:
Using FindXXXPluginByName does not apply these filters which are needed to avoid applying volume operations unto volumes that do not support them.
