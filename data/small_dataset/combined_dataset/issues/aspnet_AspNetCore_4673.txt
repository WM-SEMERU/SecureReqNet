Improve support for bearer token authentication


The current JwtBearer middleware is pretty limited.
We need support for scenarios where an API can accept different token formats - e.g. JWT and reference token (both would use the bearer scheme on the authorization header).
What we need is


general purpose "bearer token authentication middleware"

retrieves tokens from the rfc6750 specified locations
all the necessary validation etc
proper eventing model to retrieve tokens from other locations etc



extensible token validation infrastructure

they probably need to come from DI because they need support for other dependencies like caching etc
they need access to the "top level" options - e.g. the discovery document
