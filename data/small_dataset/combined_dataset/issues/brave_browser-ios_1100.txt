Protecting Users from Truncated Domains




Did you search for similar issues before submitting this one?
Yes


Description:
Brave truncates sufficiently long domains in the address bar, revealing only a portion to the end user. Generally, this is okay. But in case like manage-myaccount.paypal.com-webapps.verifcheck.com, this can result in the user seeing only "manage-myaccount.paypal.com".


Device (iPhone5, iPhone6s plus, iPad 3, ?):
iPhone 6s (but equally applies elsewhere)


Brave Version: 1.4.1 (17.08.21.17)


Actual Behavior
Persuasive Phish.


Expected Behavior
Obviate the Phish.
