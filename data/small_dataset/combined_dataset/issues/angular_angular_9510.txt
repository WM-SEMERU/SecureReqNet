Sanitize svg attributes (e.g. xlink:href)


Angular's security schema currently defines no security contexts for SVG attributes. Some SVG attributes are security sensitive though, for example XLink hrefs in e.g. <svg:circle xlink:href="...">.
As I read the DOM schema, we might currently just not allow binding to those at all, but I haven't tested it.
