Hi everyone,
Small PR about the AppVariable class, since 3.3, we can now access the flash message using getFlashes() (shortened to flashes() in Twig templates), since > 3.4, we can now use a .env file to define environment variable, problem is, what if we need to access a value in a template?
Small exemple:

Let's imagine that I need to define a hardcoded URL in my .env file and pass it (maybe as an API endpoint?) to JS?

Actually, this look like this:
# ... 
<script type="text/javascript">
    randomMethod('{{ app.request.server.get('key')|e('js') }}'); 
</script>
That's not really a problem but I think that we can have a shortcut (like the flash one) which allow us to write easier-to-read code:
# ... 
<script type="text/javascript">
    randomMethod('{{ app.env('key')|e('js') }}'); 
</script>
Actually, this PR does not support the array usage (but this could be added if needed):
# ... 
<section>
    {% for key, value in app.env(['firstKey', 'secondKey']) }} %}
        # ...
    {% endfor %}
</section>
This PR is based on a recent project where I needed to pass the Mercure hub URL to my JS code, the JS code made a call to the HUB and I can't pass the URL in a plain value in my template (as it can change due to Docker and server configuration).
This PR is not fully tested for now (mainly for the array usage and the case where Request is null) but it can be improved) but I thought that it could be a good idea to discuss it before finishing the tests.
Thanks for the feedback.
