`--join-cluster` feels like hanging when new nodes are joining


Just a detail for now but adding new nodes feels like hanging with the new acceptance process. We should probably log something when adding a new node:
[INFO] Waiting for cluster membership to be approved to proceed with further action...

Or something like that...
