Verify integrity of dependencies in production with yarn


After #1391 we will be using yarn to install dependencies in production.
Let's make sure all packages get installed without any surprises.

A production install should never upgrade a package or its dependencies, even if a sub-dependency is declared with a loose version range. Please see this detailed example of what we should prevent.
Verify the integrity of all packages. If one gets tampered with, the install step should fail. (Does yarn already do this by default? Maybe we need yarn check)

This issue is about preventing malware on NPM from creeping into a production build (see the eslint malware scenario as an example). It would still be possible for a developer to unknowingly introduce malware when upgrading a dependency -- that problem is out of scope.
