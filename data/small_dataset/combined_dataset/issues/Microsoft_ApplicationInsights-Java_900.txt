RemoteDependencyTelemetry causes com.sun.jdi.InvocationException.


SDK Version: 2.3.1
Configuration:
TelemetryConfiguration.getActive().getChannel().setDeveloperMode(developerMode);
TelemetryConfiguration.getActive().setInstrumentationKey(applicationInsightsKey);
TelemetryClient telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient();
QuickPulse.INSTANCE.initialize();
Issue:
RemoteDependencyTelemetry telemetry = new RemoteDependencyTelemetry();
Causes:
com.sun.jdi.InvocationException occurred invoking method in Eclipse debugger.
Subsequent issues not sure if this is the root cause but at times in the Java SDK dependency telemetry is not logged to Application Insights it is very intermittent.
