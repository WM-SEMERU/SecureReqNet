AWS IAM policy cleanup for Master & Node Instance Groups


Following on from PR #3343, there are some outstanding tasks to look into:

Make ASG permissions optional based on use
Prefix ASG permissions based on related resource
Make IAM Cert permissions optional based on use of certs on ELBs
Validate the correct set of ECR actions are allowed
Extend the Equal function to support checking Condition Keys
Route53 check on China region and fail accordingly (R53 not currently supported there)

FYI @chrislovecnm , are there any I've missed off?
