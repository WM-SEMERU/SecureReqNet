HealthInformation - Ambiguity in TimeToLive allowed values


From HealthInformation.TimeToLive's remarks (emphasis mine):

When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency
than time to live. If clients report on transition, they can set the time to
live to infinite.

Based on this, I expect the property to accept a value of System.Threading.Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan, which evaluates to a TimeSpan of -1 milliseconds. Instead, the property throws an ArgumentException claiming the TimeSpan must be greater than 0.
