[Feature] Apply Spread stanzas to Parameterized Jobs


Experiment:
Cluster with 9 clients.
Quickly schedule 1000 parameterized jobs with a spread stanza.

Job:
job "parameterized-test" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "batch"
  parameterized {}
  spread {
    attribute = "${node.unique.id}"
  }
  task "parameterized-test" {
    driver = "exec"
    config {
      command = "/bin/bash"
      args = ["-c", "sleep 10; date -u"]
    }
  }
}
Script:
#!/bin/bash

for _ in {1..1000}; do
  nomad job dispatch parameterized-test &
done
Version:
Nomad v0.9.0-rc1 (7c00ab4f3f37cfd1e258b38fd2ad99e7bc23e4c3)

Result:
client-1: ~1000 allocs
client-{2..9}: <5 allocs (if any)

This result is as I expected. It seems in line with what I'd expect from bin packing. Additionally, my understanding is that the spread stanza would work on multiple groups/tasks specified within the same job and not across a children of a parameterized job like in this case.

Feature Request:
The linked issue below mentions that "Spread at the cluster level is in a future roadmap".
That may be the solution to this request and tracking that issue may make this one redundant, but I wanted to specifically request that parameterized jobs are supported for spread-style scheduling so that in the future this experiment might result in more like ~100 allocs spread across the 9 clients.

#3690
