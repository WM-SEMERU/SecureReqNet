[DI] Bug with services declared in separated file


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.4 (not tested on previous versions)
Description
Services declared in a separate file imported in services.yaml are not initialized correctly.
It looks like the autowire: false is not taken into account? ðŸ¤”
How to reproduce
See relevant commit in this dedicated repository:
odolbeau/symfony_dic_bug@97d7106
I have the following error:
Circular reference detected for service "App\Storage\CacheStorage", path: "App\Storage\CacheStorage -> App\Storage\CacheStorage".

If you move the configuration from custom_services.yaml to services.yaml & remove the imports at the beginning of the file, it works as expected.
If you remove the imports at the beginning of the services.yaml and include custom_services.yaml from the Kernel (method: configureContainer) it works as expected as well.
