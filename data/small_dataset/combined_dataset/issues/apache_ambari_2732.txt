fix the bug of widget duplication


What changes were proposed in this pull request?
The data of widget in the database will not be deleted when the service (for example YARN) uninstalling. And when installing,will check if the widget exists by clusterId,widget_name,user and default_section_name. The focus is on default_section_name. In the if statement, the default value will be set by SECTION_NAME. But in the else statement, no default value will be set. Then the widget created in the first installation can not be find in the next installation, and another widget (same with the previous) will be created repeatedly.
