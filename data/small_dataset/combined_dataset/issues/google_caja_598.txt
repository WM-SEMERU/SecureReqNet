Forms colliding on the document.forms[name] array may confuse the container


Original issue 598 created by collin.jackson on 2008-06-13T16:38:38.000Z:
Although the document.forms object is off-limits to modules, it can be
accessed by the container. The modules may create forms that are
identically named to existing container forms, potentially overwriting
elements of this object. Thus, a container might think that it's accessing
its own form with document.forms['myform'](or the shortcut
document.myform), but actually be accessing the module's form.
Mangling form names (as suggested in issue 525) could solve this problem.
