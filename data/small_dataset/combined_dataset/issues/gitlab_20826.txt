## Description
A `.gitlab-ci.yml` may contain rules to deploy application to production server and (ususally) runs automaticaly after push. It's not always wanted that any developer could change this.

## Proposal
Add "Allow developers to change CI configuration" option to projects. If it's not selected â€” push by developer is declined if there are changes in `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
