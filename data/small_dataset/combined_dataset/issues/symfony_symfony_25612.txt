\Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener trusts that submitted data will contain string as username.
In case that provided data is array, trim (that's used on the input values) will throw trim() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given which results in a 500 status code.
Simple CURL that causes this behaviour would look like this:
curl \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8080/app_dev.php/login_check' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data '_username%5Bname%5D=user&_password=pass'

One quick solution would be to cast before passing to trim but perhaps some use of validator component would be a better approach?
