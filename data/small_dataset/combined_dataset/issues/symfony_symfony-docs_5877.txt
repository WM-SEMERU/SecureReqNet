Seems a bit weird that in the first instance you put the algorihm directly after the class and in the second case it has it's own key.
What's the purpose of Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User? The first tutorial says you should make your own user class.
Sha512 seems a bit outdated by now, perhaps the doc needs some updating?
