Display deprecated triggered during cache warmup


Hi!
Description
Currently it does not look possible to get deprecated calls generated during cache warmup.
These deprecations look to be stored in a file like var/cache/dev/srcApp_KernelDevDebugContainerDeprecations.log and they are displayed in the web profiler.
But when you have a CLI only app, one could like to see these deprecations directly in CLI (better DX IMHO).
I think that it would be interesting to display these deprecations during cache:warmup when a very verbose mode is activated like -vvv.
Also, what about a new command that would display these cached deprecations? Something like debug:deprecations or debug:cached-deprecations.
Cheers!
