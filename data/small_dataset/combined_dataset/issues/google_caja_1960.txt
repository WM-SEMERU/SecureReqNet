Cross-frame for-in is broken on Firefox 37, 38 beta


Original issue 1962 created by kpreid@google.com on 2015-04-06T23:26:43.000Z:
Firefox 37 and 38.0 beta.
var o = frame.untame(frame.iframe.contentWindow.eval('({})'));
for (var x in o) {}
The for loop throws "TypeError: undefined is not a function". This shouldn't even be possible (without proxies, and there aren't any proxies here), so it's probably a browser bug.
Any untame()d record object exhibits the problem. The unsafe eval is just to have less machinery involved.
Other language meta-operations (e.g. getOwnPropertyNames) on the object work normally.
