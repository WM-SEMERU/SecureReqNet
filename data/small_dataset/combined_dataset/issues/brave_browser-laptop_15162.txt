opening tabs, PT, session tabs opens `about:blank` when there's no Win/Tabs opened


Test plan
See #15194
Description
When opening any type of tabs or new windows via the File Menu on macOS when there's nothing else opened but Brave is still the active application, you'll get about:blank rather than about:newtab pages. Assuming it's because of either #15045 or #15047.
Steps to Reproduce

open brave via macOS and close all windows (keep brave as the active application)
select File -> New Tab and you'll get about:blank

Can reproduce the above using:

File -> New Private Tab
File -> New Private Tab with Tor
File -> New Session Tab

Actual result:
Opening about:blank pages rather than about:newtab pages.
Expected result:
Should be opening about:newtab and not about:blank
Reproduces how often:
100% reproducible using the above STR mentioned above.
