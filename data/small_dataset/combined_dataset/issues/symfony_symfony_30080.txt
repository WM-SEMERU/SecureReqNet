[Workflow] Being able to have more than one initial_place when using multiple_state store


Description
When we are using multiple_state marking store, we should be able to have multiple initial_place as well.
Example
Before
framework:
  workflows:
    order:
      supports:
      - 'Foo\Bar\Order'
      audit_trail:
        enabled: true
      type: workflow
      marking_store:
        type: 'multiple_state'
        arguments:
        - 'marking'
      places:
      initial_place: 'order_created'
After
framework:
  workflows:
    order:
      supports:
      - 'Foo\Bar\Order'
      audit_trail:
        enabled: true
      type: workflow
      marking_store:
        type: 'multiple_state'
        arguments:
        - 'marking'
      places:
      initial_place:
      - 'order_created'
      - 'order_cart'
Since multiple_state allow us to handle more than one marking, it should be same for initial_place.
