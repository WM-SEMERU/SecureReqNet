CA rotation: controller-manager needs a separate ca.crt file


What happened?
I tried to (manually) rotate my cluster's CA key over the weekend.  I discovered that /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt can actually include multiple CA keys, and this is key (hah!) to rotating the CA key.
kube-controller-manager however, can only accept a single key in the file pointed to by --cluster-signing-cert-file, since this is the key used to sign things, and not to verify things (so having multiple keys doesn't make sense).  kube-controller-manager exits immediately (with a helpful error) if --cluster-signing-cert-file includes multiple keys.
I think pointing kube-controller-manager --cluster-signing-cert-file to ca.crt works for the simple (single key) case, but is incorrect in general, since it prevents ca.crt file from being used to rotate keys.  I think the correct path is to either:

Use a different file for --cluster-signing-cert-file that only contains the single "primary" CA cert.
or
Change kube-controller-manager upstream to only use the first cert in ca.crt or some other logic to ignore additional certs.

What you expected to happen?
Able to append a new CA cert to /e/k/pki/ca.crt and have both CA certs accepted by controller jobs without other impact.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
Append an additional cert to /e/k/pki/ca.crt and restart kube-controller-manager pod
