exec does not respect `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`


What happened:
When running a container with allowPrivilegeEscalation: false the pid 1 process and its children have NoNewPrivs:     1. If I start an additional process in the same container using exec, the flag is set to 0.
What you expected to happen:
Processes started by exec should share the same settings as defined for the pid 1 process. This is true for capabilities for example.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
create a pod:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: privs-test
spec:
  containers:
    # environment will get injected by Jenkins kubernetes plugin
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
$ kubectl exec -it privs-test -- /bin/sh
/ # grep NoNewPrivs /proc/1/status    
NoNewPrivs:     1                     
/ # grep NoNewPrivs /proc/$$/status   
NoNewPrivs:     0                     
/ # exit                              
Anything else we need to know?:
Environment:

Kubernetes version (use kubectl version):
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"12", GitVersion:"v1.12.4",
