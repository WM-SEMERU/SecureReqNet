This allows creating scoped HTTP clients in one line:
$client = ScopingHttpClient::forBaseUri($client, 'http://example.com');
$client now resolves relative URLs using the provided base URI.
If one also adds default options as 3rd argument, these will be applied conditionally when a URL matching the base URI is requested.
This PR also tweaks MockHttpClient to make it return MockResponse on its own when no constructor argument is provided, easing tests a bit.
