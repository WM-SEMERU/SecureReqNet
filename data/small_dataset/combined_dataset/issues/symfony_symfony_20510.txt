[Security] The TokenBasedRememberMeServices does not call eraseCredentials, so the cookie will always mismatch


Tested with Symfony 3.2-BETA1
Since the RememberMeTokenService doesn't call the AuthenticatenManager, the User gets loaded without a call to eraseCredentials(). Since the remember me token was set with erased credentials, the cookie hash always mismatches:
Reproduce:
Use a User with an eraseCredentials method.
1: Authenticate as user with rememberme settings
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Authentication/AuthenticationProviderManager.php#L95
2: close browser and reopen url
In https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/RememberMe/TokenBasedRememberMeServices.php#L56 the hash from the code (without password) is checked against a new generated hash (with password), this fails now.
Adding a $user->eraseCredentials() above seems to fix the bug.
Not sure if the actual eraseCredentials should go into https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Authentication/Provider/RememberMeAuthenticationProvider.php since it's called after the "mismatch"
Maybe the https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/RememberMe/PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices.php is also affected, there's also no eraseCredentials() call
