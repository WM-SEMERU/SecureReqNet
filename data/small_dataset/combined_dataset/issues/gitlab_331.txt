I made some changes in the current version of GitLab. When I create a new project, the repo is automatically initialized. A .json is coppied in it at creation. Then I have a new page, like project_name/new_page where I have some form with data (added by project creation).

When I want to edit that data, I want to update my JSON file. HOW?
In the update_product of projects_controller I have this: (it works)

::Products::UpdateService.new(@project.product, current_user, params).execute

But I want also to update the .json file with this data.

I tried with this:

file_path = File.join(@path, 'product.json')
params[:content] = "test"
Files::UpdateService.new(@project, current_user, params, @ref, file_path).execute

I added this line at the begining:

require_relative "../services/files/base_service"

but I thing it still fails to know that @ref and @path is.

I tried with this too:

edit_file_action = Gitlab::Satellite::EditFileAction.new(current_user, @project, @ref, file_path)
created_successfully = edit_file_action.commit!(
params[:content] = 'test',
params[:commit_message] = 'test',
params[:encoding] = 'text'
)

How to make the correct @ref and @path visible to the projects_controller?
