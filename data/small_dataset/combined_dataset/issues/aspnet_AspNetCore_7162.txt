Add benchmarks for auth infrastructure and hot paths


One area we haven't tried to benchmark yet is AuthN and AuthZ.
High priority as these happen on most requests:

AuthenticationMiddleware, handler resolution, etc..
Authorization policies
Cookie Auth, decrypting, deserializing, and verifying
Jwt bearer auth, deserializing, and verifying

Low priority, these only happen on a small percentage of requests:

Cookie creation and refresh, seralizing, encrypting
OAuth and OIDC challenges and logins
