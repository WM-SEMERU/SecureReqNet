The presence of admission webhooks on /scale breaks /scale


Adding a validating admission webhook targeting deployments/scale (or any other /scale) breaks all such scale operations when the dynamic webhook admission plugin attempts to serve the plugin, and convert Deployment to Scale when trying to prepare the old object.
Reproducer:

register a webhook targetting deployments/scale (you don't need a backing hook)


whconfig.yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test-repro
webhooks:
- name: test-repro.test.k8s.io
  clientConfig:
    url: https://localhost:8675/hook
    caBundle: <your CA bundle>
  rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    apiVersions: ["*"]
    operations: ["*"]
    resources: ["deployments/scale"]



kubectl scale deploy/<some-deployment> --replicas=2


observe that you get an InternalServerError with an error about converting Deployment to Scale


The line responsible for the error is 


kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/plugin/webhook/generic/webhook.go


        Lines 177 to 181

 if oldObj := attr.GetOldObject(); oldObj != nil { 



 out, err := ConvertToGVK(oldObj, attr.GetKind(), o) 



 if err != nil { 



 return apierrors.NewInternalError(err) 



 	}
