Basic Authentication in Symfony and linked pages


Hi everyone..
I try to figure out how works the basic authentification in Symfony 2.
This is my security.yml
security:
encoders:
    Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User: 
        algorithm: pbkdf2
        iterations: 1000
        encode_as_base64: false

providers:
    administrators:
        entity: { class: AcmeUserBundle:User, property: username }

firewalls:
    secured_area:
        pattern:    ^/
        access_denied_url: /forbidden
        http_basic: ~

access_control:
    - { path: ^/adminBack, roles: ROLE_BACKEND }
    - { path: ^/, roles: ROLE_USER }

I have 2 pages with two different routes :
/web/app_dev.php/adminBack/create/user
/web/app_dev.php/anything

Checking the 2 pages seperatly (start the browser again to lose the session) with different roles, everything behaves like expected.
Then I link the two pages :
<a href="{{path('acme_user_anything')}}">Anything</a> (on the first page)

if the user I have in the database does not have the ROLE_USER, (but just the ROLE_BACKEND) I can only sign in on the first page and when I click the link I have a 403 error page for 'anything' route.
My problem :
if the user has the two roles I can go to the two pages but on the second page it is like I lose the user (I am not authenticated anymore... like I was on the first page).
Moreover, if I put the user in the session in the first page controller, it is empty in session on the second page.
Thank you for the help
PS : if I add a link in the second page back to the first page : the user is present again.
Can you only authenticate just for one role ? it seems strange,  I need help

I wanted then to have my own form to login... Here is my security.yml now :
security:
    encoders:
      Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User: 
        algorithm: pbkdf2
        iterations: 1000
        encode_as_base64: false

    providers:
      administrators:
        entity: { class: AcmeUserBundle:User, property: username }

    firewalls:
      dev:
        pattern:  ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
        security: false
      login_firewall:
        pattern:    ^/login$
        anonymous:  ~
      secured_area:
        pattern:    ^/
        access_denied_url: /forbidden
        http_basic: 
            realm: "Zone de sécurité"
        anonymous: false

        #formulaire de connexion
        form_login:
            login_path:  /login
            check_path:  /login_check

    access_control:
      - { path: ^/login, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
      - { path: ^/adminBack, roles: ROLE_BACKEND }
      - { path: ^/, roles: ROLE_USER }

It goes to my form, I sign in, no credetials error, I go to page 1 :
And I am not authenticated, user is null.
It looks like it is linked with the problem I had before ..
Help please ..
