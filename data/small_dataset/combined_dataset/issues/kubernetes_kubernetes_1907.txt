Distribute auth tokens to pods


Before allowing pods to make changes to the cluster state, we need to check their identity and verify that they're permitted to make changes.
An idea for checking identity: suppose we generate a token when a BoundPod is created. Kubelet passes this token into the pod via an ENV var. apiserver can then look up this token to verify identity.
Clearly there's some security implications; if the wrong actor is able to read the BoundPods endpoint, they could impersonate another pod.
