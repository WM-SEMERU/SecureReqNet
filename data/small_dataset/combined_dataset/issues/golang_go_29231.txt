cmd/go: directory traversal in "go get" via curly braces in import paths


go get downloads and builds source code. It is not supposed to allow arbitrary filesystem writes.
The go get command is vulnerable to directory traversal when executed with the import path of a malicious Go package which contains curly braces (both { and } characters). Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). The attacker can cause an arbitrary filesystem write, which can lead to code execution.
