Improve ELB healthchecks for API


So after the presentation at the Deis office, we had some great feedback regarding making improvements to the AWS ELB healthchecks.
We have the API infrastructure in place in kops already to add health checks.. we just need some feedback from the community on what seems relevant here.
The biggest use case we heard about was pointing the ELB healhcheck to the healthz endpoint on the Kubernetes API server. Does anyone have anything else?
