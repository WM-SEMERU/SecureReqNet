Failure to load an external script is not fatal


Original issue 541 created by felix8a on 2008-06-12T14:42:04.000Z:
if <script src="..."> doesn't NPE (issue 540)
and the external js can't be loaded,
caja emits PluginMessageType.FAILED_TO_LOAD_EXTERNAL_URL,
which is a warning.
I don't think this can break the sandbox,
but it might interfere with security assumptions of gadgets,
since I can sometimes artificially force your server to fail while your
gadget is being cajoled.
