Server-side Blazor template cleanups for Preview 4


Some parts of this should be understood as proposals for discussion. I'm OK with changing this further. The commits in this PR are:

Rename Host.cshtml to _Host.cshtml

Is this a legitimate change? My goal is to make the file layout more comprehensible. I find it jarring that we have Host.cshtml in the same Pages directory as the component pages, and yet we expect people to understand that "host" is in its own special category. By prefixing with _, (1) it becomes more visually obvious that it's not a regular file like the others there, and (2) with alphabetical sorting, it moves up to the top alongside _Imports.razor, making the groupings easier to parse visually.
If I understand correctly, the leading-underscore-on-cshtml convention usually means "not something users can navigate to", which is true in this case, in the sense that visitors can't go to yoursite/Host in typical cases. This file is an implementation detail of how your components are hosted.


Update: reverted this one for reasons given by @javiercn below In Startup.cs, change endpoints.MapComponentHub(); to endpoints.MapComponentHub<App>("app");

During preview 4 (and maybe preview 5) I think this is important for discoverability. If people want to disable prerendering, or even more so if they want to use a plain .html file as their host page, they have to specify the root component name and selector. But that will be almost impossible to discover unless we put this code here by default.
I don't think this constitutes any major drawback for the out-of-box case where it's not strictly necessary.
Longer term, this could change to something like endpoints.MapComponentHub().AddRootComponent<App>("app");, though maybe we would decide the discoverability is not a problem once we have some way to emit a non-prerendered placeholder from _Host.cshtml, and then just remove it from the default template.


Remove unneccesary dependency on NewtonsoftJson package

Nothing to discuss with that


Remove unnecessary MapRazorPages and make blank lines consistent

I think this is non-controversial too


Rename Services subdirectory to Data

I know this might sound shallow, but this is something I do care about: it really annoyed me that alphabetically, Services was splitting up Pages and Shared even though the latter two are close friends and Services is quite different. In any case, I also found it the assumption that people should have Services as an architectural pattern around data was too specific as well. The directory still contains a WeatherForecastService so it's still leaning that way, just not as strongly now.
I also considered naming the directory DomainModel though I'm worried this might lead people to make presumptions about DDD somehow being the one true sanctioned architectural philosophy
Overall, I think our goal should be to avoid implying you should organize by file type or role. Almost everyone who builds larger apps recognizes the preference to group by feature area and not as Controllers, Models, Partials, Pages, Services, Utils, css, js, images, etc. At a higher level, splitting by domainmodel-vs-UI is pretty well established though, and often these two are in different projects.
There is prior art for Data in our templates - see StarterWeb-CSharp


Remove favicon.ico

This was previously a workaround for a limitation in Preview 3 and before. It's just not needed now, and removing it makes this template more consistent with others.
