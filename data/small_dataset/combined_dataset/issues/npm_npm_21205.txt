NPM docs website shows wrong `last modified` date


I'm opening this issue because:

 npm is crashing.
 npm is producing an incorrect install.
 npm is doing something I don't understand.
 npm is producing incorrect or undesirable behavior.
 Other

What's going wrong?
Last modified date in docs is wrong, e.g. https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci shows Last modified October 26, 1985.

How can the CLI team reproduce the problem?
Go to https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci and scroll down.
