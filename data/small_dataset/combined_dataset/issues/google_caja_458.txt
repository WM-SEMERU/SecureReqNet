Fasttrack flags can be inappropriately inherited


Original issue 458 created by davidsarah.hopwood on 2008-06-10T17:24:58.000Z:
What steps will reproduce the problem?

In the testbed applet, enter

var f = loadModule('keystoneKop').f;
({isPrototypeOf: f}).isPrototypeOf();
Alerts 'You get a cookie'.
The problem is that isPrototypeOf is whitelisted on Object.prototype (the
canCall fasttrack flag is set). If isPrototypeOf is overridden, the
fasttrack flag is inherited, even though it might not be appropriate for
the inheriting object.
There are many possible variations on this bug. It seems like it should not
ever be possible for an object that has fasttrack flags set on it to be
used as a prototype, since the flags can't be consistent for two different
objects.
What version of the product are you using?
