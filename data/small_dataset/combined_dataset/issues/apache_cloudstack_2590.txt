network: Fix security groups for CentOS


On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora the bridge related sysctl rules are enabled
in kernel by default but can only be disabled. Enabling those keys
will fail, causing iptables/ebtables tables to not be created
and fails SG on CentOS. Therefore, SG does not work on CentOS.
This also fixes an integration test case, which assumes first few
tests complete within 3 minutes. In nested env the value may be large,
this increases the value to 20 minutes.
