proposal: crypto/tls: provide a way to access local certificate used to set up a connection


While TLS provides ConnectionState() to share some connection security info, like remote certificate (PeerCertificates),  it lacks the info about local certificate used to set up a connection. And it's not always possible to predict local certificate used as the selection depends on the remote end requirements.
Exposing the local certificate would be very helpful for debugging connection issues, for example, user may find certificate getter returns suboptimal certificate, which may be expiring soon or having a long verification chain. Moreover, it will also enable collecting certificate usage statistics, which could be valuable for service owners.
@FiloSottile Thanks!
