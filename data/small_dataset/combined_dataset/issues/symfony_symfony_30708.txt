Highlights:

messenger:consume can now consume messages from multiple transports with priority ❗️

bin/console messenger:consume amqp_high amqp_medium amqp_low


How long you want to sleep before checking more messages is now an option to messenger:consume
ReceiverInterface::receive() is replaced with ReceiverInterface::get()
Logic for looping & sleeping is moved into Worker
