Add out-of-the-box support for *.md in Angular apps


Issue: #6434
What I did
In Angular apps (in theory this affects every TS-project) you had to add a module for being able to import *.md files or Storybook cannot start
I added this module declaration in sb init
How to test

Checkout this branch
yarn && yarn bootstrap --core
Link lib/cli locally
Create a new Angular app and run sb init
Create a markdown file and use it inside a story

Storybook should be able to start and markdown should work out-of-the-box
