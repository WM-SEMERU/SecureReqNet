example_simple.php throws HTTP ERROR 500 after login - Debian 8 Linux Server


Dear All,
I am new to the phpCAS client. I just tried to run the example_simple.php on my project server (Debian 8 Linux hosted on AWS, Apache and PHP already configured and working correctly).
It redirects as expected to the CAS login page but after authentication it throws  HTTP ERROR 500 instead of the Successful Login page.
I tried the same code with similar configuration on my shared hosting server (Hostgator) and it everything worked correctly. I have tried to figure out why it is not working on my project server without success. Please I need help.
