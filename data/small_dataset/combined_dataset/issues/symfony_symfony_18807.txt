AuthenticationFailureEvent not triggered for AccountStatusException


I have a subscriber to AuthenticationFailureEvent but it isn't triggered for AccountStatusException's.
Ref: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Authentication/AuthenticationProviderManager.php#L85
Is there a reason for this?
