[Security] Remove VoterInterface::supports{Attribute,Class}


These methods are never used by Symfony. So there is no point in making
them part of the VoterInterface. Plus it is confusing to the developer who
implements it.
In fact these methods appear once in
AccessDecisionManager::suports{Attribute,Class}. But again, these
methods are never called, so I removed them to.
