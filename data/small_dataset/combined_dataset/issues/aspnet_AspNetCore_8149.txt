Authorize Attribute should have a flag to Override previous Authorize Attributes Controller - Method


The Problem
[Authorize(policy: "SuperAdmins")]
public class SettingsController{

     .... Save, Update, Delete, Other Stuff  ...

     [Authorize(policy: "EveryOne")]
     public ... GetSettingA(){
     }
}

This GetSettingA is not allowed because SuperAdmins policy is also applied.
The Workaround for this is to create 2 Controllers. This Workaround is not nice because there are 2 different urls, in swagger 2 sections for frontend people to look, 2 files for backend people.
[Authorize(policy: "SuperAdmins")]
public class SettingsController{
     .... Save, Update, Delete, Other Stuff  ...
}
[Authorize(policy: "EveryOne")]
public class SettingsForAllController{

     [Authorize(policy: "EveryOne")]
     public ... GetSettingA(){
     }
}

The Proposition
A better approche
[Authorize(policy: "SuperAdmins")]
public class SettingsController{

     .... Save, Update, Delete, Other Stuff  ...

     [Authorize(policy: "EveryOne", OverideAllOtherPolicies: true)]
or
     [Authorize(policy: "EveryOne", CheckOnlyThisPolicy: true)]
or
    Something else that does the job
     public ... GetSettingA(){
     }
}
