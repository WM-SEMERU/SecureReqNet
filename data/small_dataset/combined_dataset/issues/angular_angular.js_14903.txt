fix($sanitize): blacklist the `usemap` attribute


Backport of 234053f.
BREAKING CHANGE:
The $sanitize service will now remove instances of the usemap attribute from any elements passed to it.
This attribute is used to reference another element by name or id. Since the name and id attributes are already blacklisted, a sanitized usemap attribute could only reference unsanitized content, which is a security risk.
