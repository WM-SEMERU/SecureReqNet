Details:
When editing a comment into a GitLab issue, its content (no matter if in markdown code or not) will be interpreted and executed.

For example, the simple comment `<img src="not" onerror="alert(1)" />` can be inserted into a comment and saved without execution. When edited however, the code will be triggered.

## Impact

If an admin were to edit a malicious comment of a user, the XSS would be triggered into his browser. This scenario was however not tested.
