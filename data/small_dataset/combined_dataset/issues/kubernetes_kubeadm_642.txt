Enable ValidatingAdmissionWebhook and MutatingAdmissionWebhook


Since 1.9, ValidatingAdmissionWebhook and MutatingAdmissionWebhook are beta. Kubeadm should enable them by default. There are two parts to this:

Setting the --admission-control flag to api server.
Providing / Managing kubeconfigFile for webhook. My understanding is that
--admission-control-config-file flag is for kube api server and then this flag points to a file like

{
   "webhookAdmission": {
       "kubeConfigFile": "actual-kubeconfig-path"
   }
}

In the admission control config file, we have to point to a kubeConfigFile path. That kubeconfig will have the client certs for api server to use. This kubeconfig should use clients certs issued from --requestheader-client-ca-file.
So, the question is should Kubeadm do these by default ?
