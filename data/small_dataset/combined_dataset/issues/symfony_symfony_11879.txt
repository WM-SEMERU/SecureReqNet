[SecurityBundle] SwitchUserListener deal with attemptSwitchUser and LogicException


Hi,
I would like to know how you deal with the SwithUserListener and the LogicException here : 


symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/SwitchUserListener.php


         Line 91
      in
      397687f






  throw new \LogicException(sprintf('Switch User failed: "%s"', $e->getMessage())); 




    ?
Example, from your backend you switch on user, then you change again with an other user and you have a LogicException. Ok.
So with on the kernel.exception I can get this exception but I don't know if this LogicException is throw from this Listener or an other.
May be we need a specific exception.
This was introduced by this PR #3580
