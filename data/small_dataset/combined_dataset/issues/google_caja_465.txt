html4-attributes-whitelist has attributes of prohibited elements


Original issue 465 created by adriennefelt on 2008-06-10T18:31:43.000Z:
What steps will reproduce the problem?

Go to caja.lang.html4-attributes-whitelist.json
Look at the file

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Attributes of prohibited elements are on the attribute whitelist, such as all of the <OBJECT>
attributes (codebase, align, etc.).  I can't see any way to exploit this at the moment (since the tag
will still be denied based on the OBJECT name) but it seems like something that ought to be fixed.
Please use labels and text to provide additional information.
