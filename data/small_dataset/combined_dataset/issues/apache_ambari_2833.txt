[AMBARI-25166]:Modifying the value of node memory in the YARN service will affect the maximum value of container memory, but the modification cannot be saved.


What changes were proposed in this pull request?
AMBARI-25166 repairs the following problem: Modifying the value of node memory in the YARN service will affect the maximum value of container memory, but the modification cannot be saved.
How was this patch tested?
We cannot save the maximum value of container memory associated with node memory value when modifying the YARN node memory.
see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-25166
For example:
The following is the initial configuration:

Step 1: if we modify the node memory (Memory allocated for all YARN containers on a node) in YARN CONFIGS page, the maximum value of "Minimum/Maximum Container Size (Memory)" and the current value of "Maximum Container Size (Memory)" will be affected.

Step 2: however, the configuration modifications do not take effect when we click the "save" button.

Step 3: Now we can save the maximum value of container memory when modifying the value of node memory with the committed modifications.
