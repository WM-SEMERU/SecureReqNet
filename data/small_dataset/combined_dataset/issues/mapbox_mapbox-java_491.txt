AutoValue


Looking into the AutoValue suggestion in #450, I successfully converted two model classes to see how this would work. There are going to be significant API breaking changes if we want to fully implement this. I also didn't mess around with adding Builders for each class since you can call create() passing in all the params and receive a built object.
Using AutoValues also enforces classes to be immutable which makes sense for these models, you can currently call setRoute at any time after constructed.
Would love to hear your thoughts on this @zugaldia
