chore(deps-dev): bump typescript from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2


Bumps typescript from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2.

Release notes

TypeScript 3.4.2
This update solely changes TSServer to provide responses to configurePlugin requests, and allows global plugins to be loaded by external projects during project creation. This enables TSServer plugins (like IntelliCode) to be used in editors like Visual Studio.
