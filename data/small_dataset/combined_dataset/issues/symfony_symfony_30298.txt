[YAML] Bogus { } is not treated as an error


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.3
Description
Given the following YAML:
access_control:
    - test: abc,
      ips:
        - 127.0.0.1
        - ::1
    - {
        test: abc
        ips:
          - 127.0.0.1
          - ::1
      }
    - {
        test: abc
        ips:
            - 127.0.0.1
            - ::1
      }
The output should be an error, while instead the code is parsed info
How to reproduce
dd(Yaml::parse("access_control:
    - test: abc,
      ips:
        - 127.0.0.1
        - ::1
    - {
        test: abc
        ips:
          - 127.0.0.1
          - ::1
      }
    - {
        test: abc
        ips:
            - 127.0.0.1
            - ::1
      }
"));
Possible Solution
I'm not confident to dig into the YAML component parser ;)
Additional context
The actual output looks like the following:

This combined with the fact security component doesn't validate IPs caused a small headache ;)
