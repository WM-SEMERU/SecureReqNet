Manual spectre 1 mitigation by inserting lfence at both branches of a…


… conditional.
In this context, lfence has the behavior of "stop speculative execution".
Note: Inserting it before the cmp instruction, or after the cmp but before the jmp does not
have the same semantics as inserting at the targets. lfence instruction stops speculative
execution at that point; but instructions following it can still speculatively execute once
the processor has executed the lfence itself. There for if lfence is inserted just after the
cmp, the instructions following it (the jumps) can be speculatively executed.
Took a pass through the following files:
libc/abort.S
enclave/start.S
enclave/core/getkey.S
enclave/core/enter.S
enclave/core/exit.S
host/linux/entersim.S
