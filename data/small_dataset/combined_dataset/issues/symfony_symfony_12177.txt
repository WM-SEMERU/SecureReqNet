document fields and logic related to account and credentials expiration


The AdvancedUserInterface in the Security Component[1] provides fields and functions which might be useful for our project[2][3] but are not documented:

isAccountNonExpired()
isCredentialsNonExpired()

The strange naming suggests that those functions were copied from spring-security[4]. Is there something to learn in the spring documentation about how to expire credentials?

How can the credentials_expire_at column be filled with a date N days after now on every password change?
How can a user still change the password, if the password is already expired? The user can't login to reach the password-change action.
How to warn the user about the passoword expiration some days in advance?
