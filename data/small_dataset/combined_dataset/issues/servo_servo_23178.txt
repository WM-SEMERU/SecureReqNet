Add PerformanceResourceTiming: ResponseEnd



Added ResponseEnd to ResourceAttribute enum in net_traits and added it to the set_attribute function on ResourceFetchTiming
Added response_end field to performanceresourcetiming.rs
In http_loader.rs, set ResponseEnd after response body read is complete, or before return due to network error.

I could use a little guidance on testing. After building and running wpt tests, I noticed that some tests now "Pass" when they were expected to "Fail". As per the wiki instructions, I've removed those expectations from the metadata.
I noticed that there are a handful of other "failing" test expectations associated with responseEnd, but those still do not pass. I looked through some similar PRs (connectEnd, redirectStart, etc) and saw that they also still have a few failing test expectations here and there. Does that mean this is OK for now? How can I better understand which tests we expect to resolve for a given issue? Thanks!
