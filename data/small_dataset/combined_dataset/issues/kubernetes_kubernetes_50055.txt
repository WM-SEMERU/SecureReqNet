PSP: provide a simple way to allow all Linux capabilities


Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?:

Uncomment only one, leave it on its own line:
/kind bug

What happened:
Currently when user tries to create a super privileged PSP, it will require cluster admin to list all Linux capabilities in PSP defaultAddCapabilities field. It would be boring to get all the Linux capabilities and put them in PSP spec.
What you expected to happen:
Just like volumes field in PSP. Can we specify * to allow all Linux capabilities?
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Anything else we need to know?:
Environment:

Kubernetes version (use kubectl version):
Cloud provider or hardware configuration**:
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):
Kernel (e.g. uname -a):
Install tools:
Others:
