make it clear about aws permissions


Problem:
It is not clear how many aws permissions we need to create a k8s cluster with kops.
Suggest solutions:
a) Would be good to maintain a list of all required permissions.
b) add dry-run for 'kops create'?
c) generate a service-user iam policy template for review prior to the 'kops create'
