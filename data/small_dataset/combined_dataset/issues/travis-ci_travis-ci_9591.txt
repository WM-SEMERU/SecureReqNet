Web SSH UI does not accept ECDSA keys


Github allows EC keys. The Travis UI does not. This seems to be a format/verification issue as the UI responds with "This is not a private key" when, if fact, it's a private key.
The key format is:
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
< 5 lines of key material >
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

In some organizations, RSA keys have been deprecated in favor of EC keys.
