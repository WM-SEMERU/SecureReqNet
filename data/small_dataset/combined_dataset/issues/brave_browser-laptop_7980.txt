Prevent navigation to non-dotted IP addresses?




Did you search for similar issues before submitting this one?
Yes


Describe the issue you encountered:
The use of non-dotted IP addresses online is rare, and often associated with malicious activity. Brave should consider whether or not to respect attempts to navigate to non-dotted IP addresses. This would include redirection by way of the location header.


Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?):
All


Brave Version (revision SHA):
0.14.0


Steps to reproduce:

Navigate to http://2955052009
Note that Brave navigates to duckduckgo.com



Actual result:
Brave resolves the decimal IP, and navigates.


Expected result:
Brave should, perhaps, refuse to navigate to these less-common patterns.


Will the steps above reproduce in a fresh profile? If not what other info can be added?
Yes


Is this an issue in the currently released version?
Yes


Can this issue be consistently reproduced?
Yes
