In #20801, we deprecated the RoleInterface. The next logical step would be to also deprecate the Role class. However, we currently have the SwitchUserRole class (a sub-class of Role) that acts as an indicator to check whether or not the authenticated user switched to another user.
This PR proposes an alternative solution to the usage of the special SwitchUserRole class by storing the original token inside the UsernamePasswordToken. This PR is not complete, but rather acts as a proof of concept of how we could get rid of the Role and the SwitchUserRole classes.
Please share your opinions whether you think this is a valid approach and I will be happy to finalise the PR.
