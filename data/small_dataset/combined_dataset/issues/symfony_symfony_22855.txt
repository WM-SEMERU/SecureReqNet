When you're using the Symfony way to test command (https://symfony.com/doc/current/console.html#testing-commands), you 'always got a deprecation when the command list is build, because the deprecation is in the __construct(), even if I never used this command in my tests.
Passing null as the first argument of "Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Command\UserPasswordEncoderCommand::__construct" is deprecated since version 3.3 and will be removed in 4.0. If the command was registered by convention, make it a service instead
