:wrench: Fix parameter bind issue for Set-Location


PR Summary
Currently, piping a FileSystemInfo object to Set-Location causes it to use the PSPath value as-is, without resolving it to a provider path. This causes $pwd to not have a Drive property set.
This PR causes it to first resolve the PSPath as an additional step and then set the location to avoid the issue.
Resolves #9293.
