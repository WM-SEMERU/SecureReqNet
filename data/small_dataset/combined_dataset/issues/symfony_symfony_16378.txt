[Security] Improvement/Evolution: several firewalls with the same pattern


Hello!
Context:
I am currently working on a site where some features are only available to authenticated members. So I have the following firewall configuration:
# app/config/security.yml:

    security:
        encoders:
            members:
                class:              VE\ProjectBundle\Model\Member
                algorithm:          sha1
                iterations:         1
                encode_as_base64:   false
        providers:
            members:
                propel:
                    class:      VE\ProjectBundle\Model\Member
                    property:   email
        firewalls:
            member_area:
                pattern:    ^/
                provider:   members
                anonymous:  ~
                form_login:
                    login_path:             /member
                    check_path:             /member/validate-login
                    username_parameter:     email
                    password_parameter:     password
                    default_target_path:    /member
                logout:
                    path:   /member/logout
                    target: /member
                    invalidate_session: false
I also have an administration area accessible to the URL "/administration" and which the following configuration:
# app/config/security.yml:

    security:
        encoders:
            administrators:
                class:              VE\AdministrationBundle\Model\Administrator
                algorithm:          sha1
                iterations:         1
                encode_as_base64:   false
        providers:
            administrators:
                propel:
                    class:      VE\AdministrationBundle\Model\Administrator
                    property:   email
        firewalls:
            administration_area:
                pattern:    ^/administration
                provider:   administrators
                anonymous:  ~
                form_login:
                    login_path:             /administration/administrator/login
                    check_path:             /administration/administrator/validate-login
                    username_parameter:     email
                    password_parameter:     password
                    default_target_path:    /administration
                    csrf_parameter:         _token
                logout:
                    path:   /administration/administrator/logout
                    target: /administration
                    invalidate_session: false
        access_control:
            administration_administrator_login:
                path: ^/administration/administrator/login
                roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY
            administration:
                path: ^/administration
                roles: ROLE_ADMIN
Problem:
I want to show in the global template of the site (behind the firewall "member_area") a link to return to the administration when the visitor is authenticated to the firewall "administration_area". In fact, I try to do something more complex, but I simplified the problem to be more clear.
/src/VE/ProjectBundle/Resources/views/globalTemplate.html.twig:
    {% if app.user and is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN') %}
        <a href="#">Return to administration</a>
    {% endif %}
Except that the pattern of the firewall is "/administration", the firewall "administration_area" is not active for the URL "/home" for example. In addition, if "app.user" is defined, it will contain an object "Member" and not an object "Administrator".
Change the pattern of the firewall "administration_area" to "^/" does not solve anything because the firewall "member_area" is executed before.
Changing the order of firewalls in the configuration ask the opposite problem. If "app.user" is defined, it will contain an object "Administrator" and not an object "Member".
Share the same context between the two firewalls appears not to be either a solution because we have not a single object "User". I want absolutely to have two separate entities (Member and Administrator).
Potential solution:
I suggest here a solution or rather an idea based on the existing. There maybe/probably better to do.
The idea is to have multiple firewalls for the same pattern.
# app/config/security.yml:

    security:
        firewalls:
            member_area:
                pattern:    ^/
            administration_area:
                pattern:    ^/
On the side of a controller, you could do this:
/src/VE/ProjectBundle/Controller/ShowPageController.php:
    if ($this->getUser('member_area') && $this->isGranted('editProfile', null, 'member_area')) {
        // Can edit his profile
    }

    if ($this->getUser('administration_area') && $this->isGranted('ROLE_ADMIN', null, 'administration_area')) {
        // Is admin authenticated
    }
The side of a Twig template, we could do this:
/src/VE/ProjectBundle/Resources/views/globalTemplate.html.twig:
    {% if app.firewalls.member_area.user and is_granted('editProfile', null, null, 'member_area') %}
        <a href="#">Edit my profile</a>
    {% endif %}

    {% if app.firewalls.administrator_area.user and is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN', null, null, 'administration_area') %}
        <a href="#">Return to administration</a>
    {% endif %}
What do you think of this proposal?
Thank you!
