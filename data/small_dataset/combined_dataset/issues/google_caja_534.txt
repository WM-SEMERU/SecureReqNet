Document the assumptions caja makes about browser features


Original issue 534 created by jasvir on 2008-06-12T05:02:26.000Z:
Caja makes asssumptions about the features a browser provides which are not
documented.  These should be documented as a series of js, html and css
tests which can be run on existing and new browsers to establish on which
ones Caja assumptions hold and thus the ones on which cajoled code executes
securely.
