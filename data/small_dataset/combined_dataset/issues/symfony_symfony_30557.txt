This is an alternative to #29132 and #27008. There are several big things:

The messenger:consume does not die if a handler has an error
Events are dispatched before, after and on error a message being handled
Logic is moved out of Amqp and into the Worker so that we can have some consistent features, like error handling.
A generic retry system was added, which works with Amqp and future transports should support.
It will work out of the box for users. Retrying works by putting the received Envelope back into the bus, but with the ReceivedStamp removed. The retry functionality has an integration test for AMQP.
Added a new MessageDecodingFailedException that transport Serializers should throw if decode() fails. It allows us to reject a message in this situation, as allowing it to fail but remain on the queue causes it to be retried forever.
A new DelayStamp was added, which is the first of (later) more stamps for configuring the transport layer (see #30558).

BC breaks are documented in the CHANGELOG.
Thanks!
