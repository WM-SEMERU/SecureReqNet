The EntityType does not need to convert the array to a collection if the project does not care about using doctrine/collections. So this can become an optional dependency.
The goal here is to reduce the dependencies of DoctrineBundle when using it in DBAL-only mode.
doctrine/persistence still brings a bunch of unwanted dependencies for a DBAL-only project, but this requires work on the Doctrine side (we discussed it with @alcaeus) as the ConnectionRegistry is part of it. Moving it to an optional dependency in the bridge will probably come in 6 months instead.
And doctrine-cache-bundle also brings some, but that's already in the work of being removed from DoctrineBundle 2.0.
