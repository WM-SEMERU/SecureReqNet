Need a Caja-friendly JSON.js based on http://www.json.org/json2.js

Request for enhancement reported by Felix8a.
http://www.json.org/json2.js now provides a Caja-friendly JSON API. Its
implementation will not cajole, since it uses eval, as it must for good
performance.
To be made Caja-safe, it must make calls to provided functions/methods only
in a Caja-safe manner, and it must impose an additional hidden inescapable
filter function, on both serialization and unserialization, that only
allows publicly-Caja-visible properties. Fortunately, all these differences
can be achieved by wrapping json2.js rather than modifying it.
