Add identity to query metrics, logs.


Adds "identity" to metrics and logs generated by QueryLifecycle.
Also fix a bug where unauthorized requests would not emit any logs or metrics,
and instead would log a "Tried to emit logs and metrics twice" warning.
Also rename QueryResource's "getServer" to "cancelQuery", because that's what
it does.
@leventov FYI in this patch I added identity as a dimension that is always part of
query metrics. I did it for three reasons.

In 0.11 Druid now always has a concept of an authenticated user for each query. By default the authenticated user is a system superuser, but the concept is still there.
Reporting user identity is a nearly universal feature of similar software (other databases).
If a site isn't using any authorization beyond the default, then this dimension will not hurt aggregation of metrics at all, since it will always have the same value.
