500 error when deployed to prod, solved adding .UseApplicationInsights() in program.cs


Describe the bug
Basically, the web app worked in local IIS but once deployed to live via azure, I get 500 server error. So I
attached debugger and debugged remotely. Here's what I found out:


once it hits the line in controller
var user = await _userManager.FindByEmailAsync(HttpContext.User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.Name).Value);
it throws with 500 error.


once I added  .UseApplicationInsights() in Program.cs, error went away.
        WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .UseApplicationInsights()
            .UseStartup<Startup>()
            .Build();```




I'm not sure why adding .UseApplicationInsights() would fix the problem. Is this related to the settings in Azure web instance?
.net core version is 2.0
