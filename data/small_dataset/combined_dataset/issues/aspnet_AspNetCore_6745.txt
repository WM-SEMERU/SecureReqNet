JwtSecurityTokenHandler should have safer defaults


Describe the bug
JwtSecurityTokenHandler used by ASP.NET Core JwtBearerHandler has unsafe defaults.
DefaultTokenLifetimeInMinutes = 60
MaximumTokenSizeInBytes = 2097152 (~2.09MB)
To Reproduce
New up JwtSecurityTokenHandler with defaults
Expected behavior
I understand there is some inheritance going on here but for JwtSecurityTokenHandler  I would suggest:
DefaultTokenLifetimeInMinutes should have a safe default 5 minutes
MaximumTokenSizeInBytes should have a safe default 250000
Or at least a warning in the documentation with some best practice guidelines.
