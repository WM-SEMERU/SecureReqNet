test/e2e/network: Honor --dns-domain in more places


Try to finish what commit 4c8a65a started; that is, do not assume
cluster.local is a constant base domain, when it is configurable.
This makes DNS e2e tests pass with --dns-domain, which was only being honored
for some tests, not all. I hope I understood the purpose of this flag correctly.
