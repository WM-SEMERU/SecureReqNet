Create tests for the expected behaviour of all Javascript constructs used in cajoled code


Original issue 537 created by zestyping on 2008-06-12T06:52:36.000Z:
Tests are, in a sense, an executable specification of the behaviours
you expect; creating them will help ensure that everyone knows what
those expectations are.  If you run them on all the browsers you care
about, you'll be much more likely to discover whether your assumptions
have been violated, and whether they become violated when new versions
of browsers come out.
Keeping these tests in sync with changes to the cajoler is important;
you should also create a suite of tests that checks that the cajoler
produces only the constructs you expect.  (For example, give several
samples of large Caja programs as input, and parse the cajoled output
to verify that it contains only constructs from the set of JavaScript
constructs you have specified and tested.)
