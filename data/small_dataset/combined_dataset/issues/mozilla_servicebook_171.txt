[Security] Bump requests from 2.19.1 to 2.21.0


Bumps requests from 2.19.1 to 2.21.0. This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Moderate severity vulnerability that affects requests
The Requests package through 2.19.1 before 2018-09-14 for Python sends an HTTP Authorization header to an http URI upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network.
Affected versions: <= 2.19.1



Changelog
Sourced from requests's changelog.

2.21.0 (2018-12-10)
Dependencies

Requests now supports idna v2.8.

2.20.1 (2018-11-08)
Bugfixes

Fixed bug with unintended Authorization header stripping for
redirects using default ports (http/80, https/443).

2.20.0 (2018-10-18)
Bugfixes

Content-Type header parsing is now case-insensitive (e.g.
charset=utf8 v Charset=utf8).
Fixed exception leak where certain redirect urls would raise
uncaught urllib3 exceptions.
Requests removes Authorization header from requests redirected
from https to http on the same hostname. (CVE-2018-18074)
should_bypass_proxies now handles URIs without hostnames (e.g.
files).

Dependencies

Requests now supports urllib3 v1.24.

Deprecations

Requests has officially stopped support for Python 2.6.
