SecurityContextDeny Admission Controller could be refactored


I found that SecurityContextDeny could be improved:

stale comment on Admit() function can be fixed (should also mention SupplementalGroups and FSGroup fields)
we can extract function for checking PodSecurityContext
we can extract function for checking SecurityContext

After extracting functions Admit() method will be shorter and easy to read, without duplicated code and verbose details.
