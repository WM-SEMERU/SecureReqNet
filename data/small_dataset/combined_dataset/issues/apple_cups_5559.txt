Questions about timeout when waiting for an IPP response and notification while waiting


We (i.e. SUSE) analyzed a customer issue
with a printer device that gets its print jobs via IPP
(the CUPS ipp backend submits jobs to the printer)
where sometimes a print job "hangs up".
In such cases it helps to terminate the CUPS ipp backend
and when it re-runs it can (re)-submit that same print job
that had "hang up" before.
We analyzed a TCP dump of such a hanging job submission
and got the following communication up to the point where it hangs
(job names, user names and other IDs are replaced by XXX or NNN here)

The printer never sent back an IPP response to the IPP request in frame 53942.
The printer must send an IPP response, even if we submit wrong/invalid data,
so the root cause is inside the printer.
It seems CUPS waits endlessly for an IPP response
(at least it waits more than one hour).
Therefore my first question:
Is it possible to specify a general timeout
how long CUPS waits for an IPP response?
I think the ipp backend URI option contimeout does not help here
because I think that timeout is not checked in this case here.
While CUPS is waiting for an IPP response no messages appear
in the CUPS log file (at least none with LogLevel debug).
This is how the CUPS log file looks up to the point where it hangs
D ... Sending file using HTTP/1.1 chunking...
D ... Read 16384 bytes...
D ... Read 16384 bytes...
D ... Read 16384 bytes...
D ... Read 16384 bytes...
D ... Read 12100 bytes...

For comparison how the CUPS log file looks when things work
after the "hanging" CUPS ipp backend was terminated
and when it re-runs it can (re)-submit that same print job
that had "hang up" before
D ... Sending file using HTTP/1.1 chunking...
D ... Read 16384 bytes...
D ... Read 16384 bytes...
D ... Read 16384 bytes...
D ... Read 16384 bytes...
D ... Read 12100 bytes...
D ... Print-Job: successful-ok-ignored-or-substituted-attributes ...
D ... Print job accepted - job ID NNN.

My second question:
Is it possible to log messages from time to time
while CUPS is waiting for an IPP response?
My third question is about user notification in such cases:
Is it possible to somehow show to the user
that a print job cannot proceed
because CUPS is waiting for an IPP response?
