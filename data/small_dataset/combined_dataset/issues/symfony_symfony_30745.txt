[BUG][Profiler][Timeline] JS error with custom events/sections


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.3-DEV
Description
Looks like #30450 broke the Timeline panel in profiler with sections other than standard symfony ones. I have a custom caching bundle that uses the Stopwatch to measure (and also display in profiler) cache call duration. When the Timeline page loads, it throws JS error because the category ovrflo_cache does not exist (as it is not one of the hardcoded ones).
How to reproduce
This controller will reproduce the problem:
    public function index(Stopwatch $stopwatch)
    {
        $stopwatch->start('some_name', 'some_category');
        sleep(1);
        $stopwatch->stop('some_name');

        return new Response('</body>');
    }

Click on the debug toolbar, go to Timeline, open Dev Tools and you'll see the error.
Possible Solution
I fiddled with the JS in @WebProfiler/Collector/time.js and I got it to work. I am ready to submit a PR with my code, but I'm not proud of it. I'm a bit rusty with JS/ES6. If you want me to submit a PR with my fix, let me know. If someone else wants to take a stab at it, the issues I found are with 2 calls

Legend.add cannot find the category in this.categories
Legend.getClassname cannot find the category in this.classnames
My fix detects those undefined values and adds the category in both places with default values.

Edit: I just pushed my fix if anyone wants to take a look at it: ovrflo@17be20a
This probably affects any third party bundle that uses the Stopwatch. We should fix this ASAP.
