Environment variable ending with '!' fails in docker run


Declaring an environment variable ending with ! (exclamation mark) causes an error when running docker
docker run -e "secretKey=mykey!"  -v /volume/shopizer:/out purgeBatch
-bash: !": event not found
if i change mykey! with mykey it works correctly
