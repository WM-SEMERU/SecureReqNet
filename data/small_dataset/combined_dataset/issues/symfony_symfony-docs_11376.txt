[Workflow] missing twig function "workflow_all_transitions"


Hi everyone,
when copy-pasting an example of the documentation regarding blocked transitions in a fresh Symfony project, I found that a Twig function is not defined (neither in 4.2 nor master).
    {% for transition in workflow_all_transitions(article) %}

Learning from #11268, maybe you also want to add this function to the core? Or should there be another example utilizing the $workflow->getDefinition()->getTransitions() function?
Best regards,
cawolf
