this a fix for the issue #29830
After deliberation, we estimate that only sid_length and sid_bits_per_character session options should be exposed. These options Ã  optional.
For others, we recommend changing your php.ini file
We can now configure the session like this :
framwork:
  session:
    sid_length: 64 //optional, recommended value is 32
    sid_bits_per_character: 6 //optional, recommended value is 5
