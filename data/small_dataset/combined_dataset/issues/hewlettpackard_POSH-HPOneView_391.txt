New-HPOVAddressPoolSubnet incorrectly has -gateway as mandatory


Please fill in as much information as possible to help resolve your issue.
Expected Behavior
Running a PS script to create the Image Streamer Address pool.
Was not planning on adding a gateway but when runing the script I get prompted for gateway since it's tagged as mandatory, which is not consistent with OV UI.
# Add iSCSI IS Pool 
$netid="192.168.2.0"
New-HPOVAddressPoolSubnet -NetworkID $netid -Subnetmask 255.255.255.0 
Get-HPOVAddressPoolSubnet -NetworkId $netid | New-HPOVAddressPoolRange -Name "iSCSI-Streamer_Boot" -Start 192.168.2.10 -end 192.168.2.30

Actual Behavior
Steps to reproduce
Run the lines above
