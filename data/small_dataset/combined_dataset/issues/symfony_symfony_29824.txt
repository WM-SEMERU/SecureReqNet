[DX][Guard] Rememberme misconfiguration improvements


While implementing Guard is easy and really powerful, we had two situations in which debugging took long while the code change was a single line. The Developer eXperience could get improved:

rememberme needs access_control to be set to IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED, and will  otherwise land at GuardAuthenticator::start
Even while rememberme is configured on security.yml method  GuardAuthenticator::supportsRememberMe (obviously) needs to return true. When this still is set to false, it will not work but also will not throw an exception

Suggestion
Not sure whether all below suggestions are possible:

Let \Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\ExceptionListener:195 check access_control when authenticationEntryPoint::start did not return a Response. Is access_control config data accessible?
Throw a clear exception in case rememberme does not match GuardAuthenticator::supportsRememberMe
Throw a clear exception in case ... there's one firewall with one guard authenticator configured, and ... rememberme does not match GuardAuthenticator::supportsRememberMe
