[Translation] replaceAttribute of not existing attribute (The index "6" is not in the range [0,4])


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.3
Description
After latest deployment of our application we started to encounter issue with symfony/translation.
composer install --no-dev  triggers cache:clear which gives following error:
In Definition.php line 269:
                                             
  The index "6" is not in the range [0, 4].  

My own investigation determined following commit to be couse of this issue:
symfony/translation@83008de
In tests provided in this commit arguments list is defined as having 7 or 8 items, while in default config there are 5 arguments
How to reproduce
Just create new symfony app, replace composer.json file with content provided bellow. Clear composer cache and vendor dir to ensure new packages will be installed. After composer finish installing (most symfony/* packages will be used in dev-master versions including symfony/translation) run:
bin/console cache:clear
Possible Solution
In symfony/translation DependencyInjection/TranslatorPass.php there should be condition checking if number of parameters allows for replacing before using replaceAttribute(6, .... From what I was able to determine in default symfony configuration class which attributes are replaced takes only 5 but there is call for replaceAttribute with 6 and 7 as attribute index. Should there be 8 parameters in constructor or is there something that I do not understand?
Additional context
For some reason composer installs 'dev-master' version. composer why output:
$ composer why symfony/translation

Minimum stability is set to "dev" due to the fact we use our own internall library that is developed in paralell.
