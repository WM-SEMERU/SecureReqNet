tameNode should not accept a value that is not a DOM node


Original issue 591 created by mikesamuel on 2008-06-13T01:25:35.000Z:
tameNode in domita.js does not check its input type.
Find some way to check that the argument is a hosted object backed by a DOM
tree.  Perhaps see JQuery for ways to determine whether a reference refers
to a DOM node.
If tameNode could be called with a user-defined object, DOMita would act as
a confused deputy since it does not use ___.readPub et al.
