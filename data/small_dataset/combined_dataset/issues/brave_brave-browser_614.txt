disable chrome.webstore.install for inline extensions

inline extensions are a huge malware risk. we should disable them in Brave.
AFAIK it is sufficient to disable the chrome.webstore.install method
note that in c71,  chrome will disable it as well (possibly with a redirect to CWS which would be slightly better UX than silently failing).
