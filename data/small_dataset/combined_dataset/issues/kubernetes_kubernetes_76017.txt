Add TLS support to kubemark


Since #70144 was merged, GCE is encrypting communication between etcd and apiserver. However, Kubemark was still using plain communication.
That is one of the reasons for the different between those two.
One of the hypothesis is that it may also contribute to the #75833 regression.
