Windows 7 - Brave (64) v71.0.57.18 - Fails to Install and Start - Blank Screen Only


Hi Devs,
I am technical. I have a relatively 'clean machine' running Windows 7.
I downloaded and installed Brave (64) v71.0.57.18... with Administrator Permissions and after dismissing the installer dialog that says successfully installed. Brave Browser is launched... but I see only a Brave Browser 'window' that is BLANK. - there are 'brave tasks' running.

the Brave Browser never recovers... the window stays blank forever.

I use Brave on all Windows and iOS devices... and have never seen this problem before.
Any ideas?
Max
