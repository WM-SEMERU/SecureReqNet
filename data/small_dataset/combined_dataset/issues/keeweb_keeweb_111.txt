Reference domain is vulnerable to MITM attacks


In this comment, you state that you only got HTTPS through CloudFlare. I also have noticed that you are hosting this app with GitHub pages. This implies that there is an unvalidated TLS connection between GitHub pages and CloudFlare.
To resolve this issue, complete the following checklist:

 Host app.keeweb.info using something other than GitHub pages.
 Get a TLS certificate for app.keeweb.info. Let's Encrypt certificates are free.
 Enable HSTS and HPKP.
 Either change your CloudFlare crypto settings to "Strict" or directly serve the website without using the CloudFlare proxy.

and/or (less secure alternative that's better than doing nothing)

 Enable DNSSEC for keeweb.info, to make it a little more difficult to MITM connections with spoofed DNS.
