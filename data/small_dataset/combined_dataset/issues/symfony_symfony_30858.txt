Currently there is an error when the table does not exists and we run the messenger:consume command.
This is because all queries made in the get method of the Connection are in a transaction. Therefore the table is not created.
To avoid this error I added a call to the setup method before starting the transaction.
I needed to add the SchemaSynchronizer as construct parameter for the tests
