CA server stuck on manager shutdown after Ctrl-C


CA server stays stuck on manager shutdown:
^C
INFO[0061] Stopping manager
INFO[0062] grpc: Conn.resetTransport failed to create client transport: connection error: desc = "transport: dial tcp addr:4244: getsockopt: connection refused"; Reconnecting to "addr:4244" 
INFO[0064] grpc: Conn.resetTransport failed to create client transport: connection error: desc = "transport: dial tcp addr:4244: getsockopt: connection refused"; Reconnecting to "addr:4244"
[etc...]

Ctrl-C has no effect at this point, I have to close my terminal.
This seems to consistently happen after the two nodes (leader/follower) get their cert:
INFO[0030] Waiting for TLS certificate to be issued...  
INFO[0030] Downloaded new TLS credentials with role: swarm-manager.

And I stop the follower after that.
We are stuck on this line https://github.com/docker/swarm-v2/blob/master/manager/manager.go#L407
