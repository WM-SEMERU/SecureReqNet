The [API docs for the users](http://api.gitlab.org/users.html) shows sample output for retrieving SSH keys. But they don't show the "created_at" data value or the date time format for that given value.

To test, simply make an API call to ````GET /user/keys```` and you'll see the extra data value.

The API should be updated to include the missing information.
