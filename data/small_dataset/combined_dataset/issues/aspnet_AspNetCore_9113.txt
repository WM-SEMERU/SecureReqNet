Getting a "The call is ambiguous between the following methods"


So, I have VS2019-Preview, I created a new project (Blazor template), copied a page from my 0.7 project to my 0.9 project, fixed the nuget issues, got everything to run.
But when I copied over the rest of my pages, I am getting this now:
"Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	CS0121	The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'RuntimeHelpers.TypeCheck(T)' and 'RuntimeHelpers.TypeCheck(Func)'	PSLM	C:\Users\James\source\repos\PSLM\PSLM\obj\Debug\netstandard2.0\Razor\Pages\Spinner Operations\Search Bale Results\SearchBalesResults.cshtml.g.cs	96	Active"
Line 96 in my html code is this:

It's literally just part of my HTML table?
