propose approach and syntax for "sugary" content digests


While the digests provide a lot of benefits, they are long and unwieldy for users. To mitigate this, we should propose a syntax for shortening identifiers, much in the way git does. It should meet at least the following requirements:

Resolves content uniquely with a low probability of collision
Shortened digests should not leak into persistent systems
The solution should not compromise security

This was request in moby/moby#10740 (comment).
