Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-8416: .NET Core Tampering Vulnerability
Executive Summary
Microsoft is aware of a tampering vulnerability exists when .NET Core improperly handles specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could write arbitrary files and directories to certain locations on a vulnerable system. However, an attacker would have limited control over the destination of the files and directories.
To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send a specially crafted file to a vulnerable system.
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core handles these files.
System administrators are advised to update PowerShell Core to an unaffected version version (see affected software.)
