# The Issue

Currently when viewing linked social accounts on a gitlab CE user profile page (ex: https://gitlab.com/profile/account ) there is no way of unlinking an account once linked.


# The Suggestion

Once a given omniauth account has been linked, display an 'unlink <servicename>' button. so for example if I've linked my google account, I should see an 'Unlink Google Account' button.
