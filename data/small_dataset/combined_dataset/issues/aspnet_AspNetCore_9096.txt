Razor Components project template doesn't have a favicon.ico


All our other web app templates have a favicon.ico in the wwwroot folder. We should probably have the same one in the Razor Components project template too. Without it, Chrome makes a request anyway then shows an error in the dev console which is less than pleasant.
