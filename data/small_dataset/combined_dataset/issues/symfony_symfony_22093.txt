If my application has multiple firewalls with some of them using the same user provider; they will be added to the AuthenticationProviderManager as unique authentication providers.
Is this intended behavior c.q. is there a use case I'm overlooking?
I would expect them to be deduplicated somewhere during the configuration compilation.
