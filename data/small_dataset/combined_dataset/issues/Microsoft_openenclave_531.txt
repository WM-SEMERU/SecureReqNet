Enable Spectre 1 mitigations for Clang


This PR enables the -mllvm -x86-speculative-load-hardening flag of Clang 7+ if available and addresses #116.
I noticed that the libunwind and mbedtls projects included with ExternalProject_Add did not have the compiler propagated and defaulted to gcc. This fixes that as well. (EDIT: extracted into #614)
Some changes to the add_compile_flags_if_supported.cmake script were necessary (EDIT: extracted into #614):

Flags that have to be tested together, like the ones above, can now be given to add_compile_flags_if_supported etc. by wrapping them in quotes.
Flags added via the language-agnostic add_compile_flags_if_supported  or add_target_compile_flags_if_supported functions now use generator expressions to apply them to C and C++ files only. This prevents warnings about unused flags specifically when using Clang for ASM compilation since compile flags in general don't apply to ASM files.

Using Clang involves specifying environment variables during configure:
CC=clang-7 CXX=clang++-7 ASM=clang-7 cmake ..
