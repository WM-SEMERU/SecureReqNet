This PR fixes #18401, as well as other possible issues:

First, the user provider no longer requires a password attribute by default. While this is not mandatory, it is more explicit to not set a password when using the form_login_ldap or http_basic_ldap, as these two providers don't use a password comparison mechanism, but ldap_bind() instead.
Second, the attribute is now configurable. Some implementations actually use different properties to store the user's password attribute. This will enable some users to correctly work with specific configurations.
Third, the user provider normalises the attribute array into a single string. Also, if the attribute has more than one value (which should not be possible), or if is not set, an exception will be thrown, with a clear error message.
