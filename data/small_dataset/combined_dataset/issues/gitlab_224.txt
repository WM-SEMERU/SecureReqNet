I do have some symbolic links within my GitLab installation due to have a more easy config:

    log -> /var/log/gitlab
    tmp -> /tmp/gitlab

rvmsudo -u git -H ruby script/upgrade.rb -y

    GitLab 6 upgrade tool
    Your version is 6.7.2
    Latest available version for GitLab 6 is 6.8.1
    Newer GitLab version is available
    Stash changed files
     -> git stash
    error: 'log/.gitkeep' is beyond a symbolic link
    fatal: Unable to process path log/.gitkeep
    Cannot save the current worktree state
     -> FAILED
    Failed to upgrade. Try to repeat task or proceed with upgrade manually

Might the fix be to change .gitignore from "log/*.log*" to "log/" ?
