refactor: extract historiesByRevision to daemon util


What type of PR is this?
/kind cleanup
What this PR does / why we need it:

The historiesByRevision in kubectl was copied directly from daemonset and should be extracted into a library.
Add unit tests to verify historiesByRevision order direction.
Use var _ sort.Interface = &HistoriesByRevision{}  to ensure historiesByRevision implements sort.Interface

Special notes for your reviewer:
I'm not sure whether to put the HistoriesByRevision struct in daemon util is a good idea. If there's a better place, please let me know, and I'll update the PR.
Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
NONE
