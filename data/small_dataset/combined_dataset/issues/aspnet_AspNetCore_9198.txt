StopApplication shuts down host but not application


Describe the bug
When calling StopApplication() on IApplicationLifetime which is resolved from DI it only stops the host but application is kept alive and running.
To Reproduce
Using ASP.NET Core Web API template call StopApplication() on resolved interface in either controller or hosted service.
Startup:
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
        }

        public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>();
Stopping, where _serviceProvider is IServiceProvider and IApplicationLifetime is Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting interface.
var lifetime = _serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IApplicationLifetime)) as IApplicationLifetime;
lifetime.StopApplication();
Expected behavior
Entire application shuts down.
Additional context
This is happening on dotnet 2.2 using WebHost to start the application.
