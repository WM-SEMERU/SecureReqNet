quickstart with Dockerfile


Description
Quickstart is the entry point that all beginners would look into. It would be nice to provide dockerfile or docker-compose file so people can start druid by docker pull, and start druid easily and immediately.
Motivation
As a beginner I would like to start druid with docker so I can easily set druid up and load some data for playing around
Currently the quickstart asks for downloading zookeeper and druid, and then start by some commands.

In addition, if user's java version is java11, it would fail due to druid supports till java8.
If using dockerfile, this would not be an issue.
