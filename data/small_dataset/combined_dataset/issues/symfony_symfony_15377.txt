SecurityDataCollector.php: Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency?


Hello,
we got the following php exeption: Fatal error: Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency? in .../vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DataCollector/SecurityDataCollector.php on line 74
The user / userRole configuration is the same as in our other projects, we use only 11 users and 2 userRoles with doctrine. After some google we could fix the error with changing the line 74
from
if (!in_array($role, $assignedRoles)) {
to
if (!in_array($role, $assignedRoles, TRUE)) {
Is this a bad or good thing?
We found a lot of information in this thread:
