According to issue symfony/symfony-docs#10442, we tested in a demo bundle, for example in src/AppBundle/Resources/config/config.yml a package using hyphens: app-client-frontend, and withouth the patch it fails because the package is not recognized. With the patch, it works as expected.
framework:
    assets:
        packages:
            app-client-frontend:
                version: "%env(FRONTEND_VERSION)%"
                version_format: '%%2$s/dist/%%1$s'
                base_urls:
                  - "%env(FRONTEND_URL)%"
