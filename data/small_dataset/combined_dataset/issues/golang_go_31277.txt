syscall: SetsockoptString does not allow empty strings


What version of Go are you using (go version)?
$ go version go1.12.1 linux/amd64


Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
Yes.
What operating system and processor architecture are you using (go env)?
Linux
What did you do?
syscall.SetsockoptString(1, 2, 3, "")
What did you expect to see?
It would be expected for an empty string to still allow the call.
What did you see instead?
panic: runtime error: index out of range
goroutine 1 [running]:
syscall.SetsockoptString(...)
	/usr/lib/go/src/syscall/syscall_unix.go:309

This happens because of the following code at https://golang.org/src/syscall/syscall_unix.go?s=7074:7137#L298:
return setsockopt(fd, level, opt, unsafe.Pointer(&[]byte(s)[0]), uintptr(len(s)))

The use of the [0] index is not compatible with an empty string.
However sometimes SETSOCKOPT with empty string is required, it would be nice to be able to do so without having to resort to use syscall.Syscall6 (for arm as an example) or whatever architecture dependent equivalent.
Thanks!
