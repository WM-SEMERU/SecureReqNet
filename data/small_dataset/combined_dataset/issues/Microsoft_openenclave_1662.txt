Fix samples test script


This was accidentally broken when Paul and I changed a tiny bit of seemingly unneeded logic for testing if simulation mode is enabled. Unfortunately, testing environment variables in CMake does not play well
with its logic operators, and so while if ($ENV{SIM}) behaved as expected, the very similar if (NOT $ENV{SIM}) behaved completely unexpectedly. This bug temporarily disabled the testing of non-simulation samples in CI.
