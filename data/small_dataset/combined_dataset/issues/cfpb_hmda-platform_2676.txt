Document source data and methodology for geographic datasets


Validation and aggregation of the HMDA LAR data require certain geographic data. This geographic data is a crosswalk between the following:

state
MSA/MD
county
census tract
names of the above geographies

Data Sources:

FFIEC Census Flat File
OMB delineation files
OMB delineation bulletins
Census API

Discussion:
The HMDA Platform currently uses geography information that is current through 12/31/2017. This version of the data is used so that all data collected during the 2018 calendar year will have homogenous geographic reference data.
All data except the geography names can be pulled from the FFIEC Census Flat File. While this creates a dependency on a non-Census data product, the use of the FFIEC Census File is still required to obtain FFIEC Estimated Median Family Income.
Geographic Data Clients:

Validity edits checking correct mapping of MSA to state, MSA to county, county to tract
Test file geographic data selection for use in testing Platform edits
Aggregate and Disclosure reports for aggregation of data to specified geographic levels
UI client for populating lists of nested geography

Requirements:

Create a complete list of data sources used to assemble the required geographic data
Draft a methodology for how these data are assembled and cleaned
