Resource controlapi Implemetation


- What I did
Finishes the controlapi implementation of Resources, which allows external users to store arbitrary data in swarmkit's store.
Additionally, alters some protobufs for a better API. Typically, such changes would be unacceptable and breaking, but as this API was never made available, there is no harm in changing it.
Subsumes my last PR, #2834
- How to test it
Includes automated tests
