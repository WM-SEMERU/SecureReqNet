tameNode should not return a functional node for an unrecognized or unsafe element


Original issue 589 created by mikesamuel on 2008-06-13T01:21:46.000Z:
tameNode will return a TamedElement for any element regardless of whether
the element name is recognized and safe.
If it isn't, we still need to return a node so that tree traversal works,
but should not return an editable node, or one that exposes details of the
node.
