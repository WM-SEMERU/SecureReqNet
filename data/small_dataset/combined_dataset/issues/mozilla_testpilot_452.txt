Update *insecure* python dependencies


Just noticed this: 
Django==1.8.4 should get upgraded to 1.8.11. Bonus point would be to upgrade all the way up to 1.9, but not sure what the changes are - best to get to a secure point release and follow up in another issue.
Pillow==2.9.0 should probably advance to 3.1.1, as long as no breaking API changes have happened.
Further bonus points would also be to upgrade all the other outdated dependencies listed. Though, not if it delays the insecure dependencies. I know that can sometimes turn into a rabbit hole of insanity.
