[Firewall] No routing and locale support


Simple use-case:
#app/config/routing.yml

languageselector:
    pattern:      /

frontpage:
    pattern:      /{_locale}
    requirements: { _locale: en|fr|de, _scheme: http }
and
#app/config/security.yml
    firewalls:
        public:
           ...
            form_login:
                check_path: ?
                login_path: ?
                default_target_path: ?
            logout:
                path: ?
                target: ?
The backrouting is very limited. Neither will work for the ? placeholder: /{_locale}, frontpage, /{_locale}/login.
I'm new to Symfony maybe im missing something but my general understanding from the docs was that routing is the main component that all other should rely on. This seems like a serious limitation for localized sites as I need to route the user through the languageselector route to get him back to the frontpage (or any localized page).
