Started dev webserver and "symfony-scripts event terminated with an exception"


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4.18
Description
I was working on the frontend of a project with the development webserver and suddenly the terminal closes; re-opened it and restarted the web server but didn't worked. Tryed a composer install as well as a cache:clear with no success.
How to reproduce
I don't know what appened because I was only doing html stuff. As I said earlier I've done a composer install (wich ended with this error) and also a cache:clear (same error)
[RuntimeException]
 An error occurred when executing the "'cache:clear --no-warmup'" command:

The crazy thing is that 5 minutes earlier everithing was working, I changed some html and pushed to production environment (the prod. env is working)
