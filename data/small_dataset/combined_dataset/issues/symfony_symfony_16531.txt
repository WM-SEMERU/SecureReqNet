The AbstractVoter is trying to get a class of an object, but if i pass a string to isGranted is breaks the complete voting process. Noticed by adding only one Voter which extends thenAbstractVoter. So currently i am unable to use this abstract class in the whole project.
So we should not support string values in this voter.
$this->isGranted('VIEW', 'foo')
