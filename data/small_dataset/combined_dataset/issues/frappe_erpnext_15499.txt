[Security Feature] Permission not working File Doctype


We want to disallow normal system users from uploading public attachments.

The File doctype is associated with Attachments. I have tried the following:

The permission level for 'is Private' checkbox was set to 1 .
Only Administrator was given write access to the 'is Private' checkbox

The Public check box is still available to all users.
Issue #9127 deals with the larger security issue with files.
