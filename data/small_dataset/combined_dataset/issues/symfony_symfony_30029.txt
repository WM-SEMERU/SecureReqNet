UniqueEntity custom error message with toString on entity does not work


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.*
Description
According to Symfony UniqueEntity documentation  if the constraint is violated then I can create a custom message error by implementing the __toString() method on my Entity.
I've attempted to create my custom message via the validation.yaml (which works) and I've implemented the __toString() method (which does not work)
According to the docs:

Messages can include the {{ value }} placeholder to display a string representation of the invalid entity. If the entity doesn't define the __toString() method, the following generic value will be used: "Object of class CLASS identified by "

How to reproduce
To reproduce, clone my project and follow README.md guide:
https://github.com/kemicofa/unique_entity_custom_message_tostring_bug
Once, the project is installed run the WebCaseTest that I've implemented.
Essentially my project will attempt to insert two users with the same email in the database.
The first works as expected and the second fails as expected. However, the second response doesn't have the expected __toString() return message sent, only the default message is sent:

Object(App\Entity\User).email: /** more text here */
