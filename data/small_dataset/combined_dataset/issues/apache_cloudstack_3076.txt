security: increase keystore setup/import timeout


This increases and uses a default 15mins timeout for VR scripts and for
KVM agent increases timeout from 60s to 5mins. The timeout can
specifically occur when keystore does not get enough entropy from CPU
and script gets killed due to timeout. This is a very specific corner
case and generally should not happen on baremetal/prod environment, but
sometimes seen in nested/test environments.
