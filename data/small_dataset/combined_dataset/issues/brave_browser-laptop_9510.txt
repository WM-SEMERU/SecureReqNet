host is not parsed correctly in titleMode



Issues:

no host defined for about pages
Trailling colon for all urls

Issue found in 0.18.x sha 3535c8d
Given this is related with security matters I'm labeling to 0.18.x itself given it is not reproducible in 0.17.x
/cc @diracdeltas
/cc @srirambv for triage
