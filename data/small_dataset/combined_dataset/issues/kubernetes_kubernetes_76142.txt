Fix TestCreateDisk by sorting tags


What type of PR is this?
/kind flake
What this PR does / why we need it:
Mock requires stable input, and in CreateDisk we invoke buildTags which uses a map to create tags, which then get converted into an array. This leads to unstable sorting order which confuses mock. Sorted tags are not needed in regular code, but are a must in tests.

Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
NONE
