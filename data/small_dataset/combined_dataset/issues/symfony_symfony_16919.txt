Routing schemes https 302


Hi,
More of a query than an issue, is there any reason then defining https as the scheme for the route the redirect from http > https is a 302 temp redirect?
Having troubles with SEO where it isn't removing the http links as they aren't marked as perm redirects.
Thanks,
Harry
