using 'simple_form' key in security.yml (following the Custom Form Password Authenticator proceess in The Cookbook) stops refreshing the user on every request


using 'simple_form' key in app/security.yml (following the Custom Form Password Authenticator proceess in The Cookbook) with a Doctrine entity as User Provider stops executing refreshUser() method of the UserProvider on every request
the user is not refreshed on every request after following the Custom Password Authenticator tutorial in The Cookbook
reverting to 'form_login' key and not using the 'authenticator' option solves the problem, either with a basic Doctrine entity as User Provider setting like
    providers:
        main:
            entity: { class: AcmeAppBundle:User, property: username }

or using a Doctirne repository as a User Provider
    providers:
        main:
            entity: { class: AcmeAppBundle:User }
