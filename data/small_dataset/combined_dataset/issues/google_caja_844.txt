Fatal Privilege Escalation introduced by erights/no-xo4a


Original issue 844 created by erights on 2008-10-18T01:29:51.000Z:
When a method is tamed as a generic method and then reified, it is
extracted as a malfunction -- a record with call, bind, and apply members.
However, if these call, bind, or apply members are called with null or
undefined for its first (this-value) argument, the original tamed method
will run with its this-value bound to the real global object.
