Move GameServer to Unheathy when Pod Deleted


There was only implementation of GameServer's being moved to Unhealthy on very specific Pod events (container crash, being unschedulable), but never on Pod removal as a whole.
Also it was locked down to specific states, which made it very fragile.
Reworked this so that any of the above now triggers a GameServer being moved to an Unhealthy state.
Closes #678
