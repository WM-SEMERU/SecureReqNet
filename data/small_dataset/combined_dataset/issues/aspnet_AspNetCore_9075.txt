Blazor option to not optimize assemblies


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I'd like to be able to use reflection in the browser to access types and methods from my dependencies that are not explicitly used in my C# code.
Describe the solution you'd like
I'd like to be able to easily deploy full versions of my Blazor app's dependencies to the browser.  It would be nice to have a per-project setting somewhere to say "don't optimize for size" so building and deploying through the usual means skip the assembly-trimming step.
Sorry if this has already been requested; I couldn't find an existing issue.
