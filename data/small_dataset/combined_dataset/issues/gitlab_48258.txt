Hi,

By using the following `.gitlab-ci.yml` in your project:

```yml
--- 
"<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>": 
  script: 
    - "echo \"hej\""
```

Then committing anything to the repository, the tooltip of the job inside the CI/CD pipeline will not be properly sanitized:

![tooltip1](/uploads/48a1cc0aa13586e7b931af8190b96906/tooltip1.png)

This also happens when viewing the specific pipeline-job:

![tooltip3](/uploads/c558f7ab2ac6cd40a81d14e82d763834/tooltip3.png)

### PoC

To reproduce, create a new repository. Create the following file in the master-branch, called `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yml
--- 
"<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>": 
  script: 
    - "echo \"hej\""
```

Commit the file, then go to CI/CD Pipelines. Hover the task and the javascript should execute.

You can also click the task and hover the pipeline inside the jobs-view for the same result.

## Impact

The stored XSS is triggering for anyone, also triggering on gitlab.com, and it can trigger on public repos. You could easily build a PoC that would modify the email address of the current user or stealing their CSRF-token as soon as the script triggers, or try stealing information about the user's other private repositories.

Frans Ros√©n

Same thing in the tooltip of the stage-viewer:
