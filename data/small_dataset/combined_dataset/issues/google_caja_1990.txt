Minor difference in string produces different output


In https://github.com/google/caja/blob/27248d0f223038346d63278b52ec038e77418ba9/src/com/google/caja/plugin/html-sanitizer.js when using javascript function parse(htmlText, handler, param) {
in javascript parseTagAndAttrs(parts, pos) {
The two badly formed html strings produce different output:
<p a='b' x='<
produces an empty dom
<p a='b' x='>
produces a dom containing a p tag, e.g. <p a="b" ></p>
This seems like a minor issue, but it's a little bit weird. It's possible this is on purpose, but based on the comments, this looks like an oversight in the way the parser is seeking out the next '>' token.
