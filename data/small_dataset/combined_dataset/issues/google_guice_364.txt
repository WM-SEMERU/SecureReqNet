Update local copy of google-collection classes to 1.0 RC1


From mcculls on April 28, 2009 13:00:49
Guice now contains a local copy of google-collection classes, taken back in
February (I can't tell exactly which level was taken).
The local google-collection classes should be updated to the 1.0 RC1 level
when possible, as this version contains various fixes - including some that
allow Guice to run on the Google App Engine.
I'm attaching a diff of the necessary changes - although it'll be much
easier for the Guice team to just use the 'copy.sh' script from trunk.
