SHA1 signed certificates accepted with no warning


Web sites using the SHA-1 Signature hash algorithm are displayed in the browser without even a warning. (Brave 0.8.2). I believe Brave should block connections to such sites as Firefox already does, and Chrome, IE and Edge by Jan 01 2017.

Chrome 49 shows a red cross on the padlock, and the "https" part of the URL is also red with red line through it. They will completely stop supporting SHA-1 by Jan 01 2017.
Firefox has rejected such sites since version 43 (Jan 01 2016) bringing up a page saying "Your connection is not secure" and does not connect to the site (unless you add an exception). (Tested with 45.0.1)
Microsoft Edge will "deprecate" them later this year and block them by Jan 01 2017.  (Currently, version 25.10586.0.0 issues no warning and displays the page).
Microsoft IE will presumably be aligned with the Edge timescales, if it is a pan-Microsoft decision (Currently, version 11.103.10586.0 issues no warning and displays the page).
Opera - I can't find anything about their policy and don't have it installed.
Vivaldi - I can't find anything about their policy and don't have it installed.
