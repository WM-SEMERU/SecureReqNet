I just installed gitlab at https://git.hacksaar.de/ . It's working fine generally, and the project we use for testing is available via https://git.hacksaar.de/public/ . However, the URL it gives to clone via HTTPS (https://git.hacksaar.de/hacksaar/sphinx.git) asks for username and password when used with git.

The expected behaviour of a project which I set up to "Public - The project can be cloned without any authentication" would be that I can clone the project without any authentication. (I'm also surprised that it even display the SSH URL to users which are not logged in as it cannot be of any use to them.) Also, with some digging I found https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/commit/b6da734824d0c7 which seems to be included since version 4 and claims to "remove auth request for public projects", but that's seemingly not the case.
