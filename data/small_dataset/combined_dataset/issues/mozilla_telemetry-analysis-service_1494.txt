[Security] Bump urllib3 from 1.22 to 1.24.1


Bumps urllib3 from 1.22 to 1.24.1. This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

High severity vulnerability that affects urllib3
urllib3 before version 1.23 does not remove the Authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the Authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext.
Affected versions: < 1.23



Changelog
Sourced from urllib3's changelog.

1.24.1 (2018-11-02)


Remove quadratic behavior within GzipDecoder.decompress() (Issue #1467)


Restored functionality of ciphers parameter for create_urllib3_context(). (Issue #1462)


1.24 (2018-10-16)


Allow key_server_hostname to be specified when initializing a PoolManager to allow custom SNI to be overridden. (Pull #1449)


Test against Python 3.7 on AppVeyor. (Pull #1453)


Early-out ipv6 checks when running on App Engine. (Pull #1450)


Change ambiguous description of backoff_factor (Pull #1436)
