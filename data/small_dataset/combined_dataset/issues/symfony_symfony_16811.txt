Security - Using a Custom Query to Load the User does not work


Symfony 3.0
PHP 5.6.11
Mac OS
PHP Built in webserver
I am following this part of the documentation:
http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/entity_provider.html#using-a-custom-query-to-load-the-user
to enable authentication with a custom query.
So I remove the 'property' entry at 'security.yml' file. And I take this message when I try to login:
"Authentication request could not be processed due to a system problem."
Same code worked for me in symfony 2.7.7. Same Entity, same entity repository ...
If I use 'property: username' it works.
This works:
providers:
    db_users:
        entity:
            class: AppBundle:User
            property: username

This does not work:
providers:
    db_users:
        entity:
            class: AppBundle:User
