I'm using the LDAP component to authenticate users in my application.
According to the docs I need a read only user to query the LDAP server, but I think this should/could be optional.
For the moment I customized the LdapUserProvider class, so the supplied username and password are used to authenticate (bind) to the LDAP server.
Is this a scenario that should be supported by the component? If so, I could work on a PR for this.
