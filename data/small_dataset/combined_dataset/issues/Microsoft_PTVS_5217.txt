Multi threaded program is not debuggable properly


I was trying to debug the attached script. This script is written for practicing multi-threading. To view each & every details of how threading is being worked I wrote this script and started debugging. But the debugger is not been able to start all the thread. Before starting all the threads it starts executing the 1st thread's target function which it should not supposed to do
To reproduce the problem please re-run the following python script and put debugger as per the screenshot provided
Please note that PyCharm Community Edition is doing this debugging properly.
Program Details: Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2019
Version 16.0.0
Python 16.0.19074.1
Python Base Version 3.7.2
==========================================================
import threading
import time
thread_lock = threading.Lock()
COUNT = 20
global_variable = 0
def inc_by_1():
global global_variable
with thread_lock:
for i in range(COUNT):
global_variable += 1
def inc_by_4():
global global_variable
with thread_lock:
for i in range(COUNT):
global_variable += 4
def dec_by_1():
global global_variable
with thread_lock:
for i in range(COUNT):
global_variable -= 1
def dec_by_2():
global global_variable
with thread_lock:
for i in range(COUNT):
global_variable -= 2
def dec_by_2_again():
global global_variable
with thread_lock:
for i in range(COUNT):
global_variable -= 2
t1 = threading.Thread(target=inc_by_1)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=inc_by_4)
t3 = threading.Thread(target=dec_by_1)
t4 = threading.Thread(target=dec_by_2)
t5 = threading.Thread(target=dec_by_2_again)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t3.start()
t4.start()
t5.start()
print("Calling from main thread::\nCurrent value of global_variable is::: {0}".
format(global_variable))
=======================ooooooooo============================
I'm sorry for writing code in this way as default code integrator was not working for my code.
