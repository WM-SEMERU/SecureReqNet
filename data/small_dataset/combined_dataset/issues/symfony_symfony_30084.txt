As the PhpUnit 8 Testcase has different return types as PhpUnit 7 there need to be 2 different classes to support both PhpUnit 8 and PhpUnit 7. With a class alias we can then change which version is used based on the PhpUnit Version constant. The fix is a little bit hacky but to support different major versions I see no other way.
Not sure as we can't upgrade symfony/symfony to PhpUnit 8 how we can create a TestCase for this change.
