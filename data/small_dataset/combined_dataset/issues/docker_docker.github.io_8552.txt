Correction to SSH Service Page


Problem description
Problem location

I saw a problem on the following URL: 

https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/running_ssh_service/
There is a fault or a missing char in dockerfile so sshd server don't work when tried to login, access denied error is given, even the password is correct.
Project version(s) affected
Suggestions for a fix
Problem is that, sshd_config's default file starts with '#' sign but below command don't have it.
RUN sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
So, it is being fixed with adding '#' as below
RUN sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
