[Security] Authenticating users with api keys using SimplePreAuthenticatorInterface


Issue originally posted by @mseshachalam at symfony/symfony#13330:
In the doc http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/api_key_authentication.html ,
the below method's second parameter is user provider.
public function authenticateToken(TokenInterface $token, UserProviderInterface $userProvider, $providerKey)
When we make the ApiKeyAuthenticator service, the same class will have a class level user provider variable.
Could some please explain the difference between these two user provider variables ?
Thanks
