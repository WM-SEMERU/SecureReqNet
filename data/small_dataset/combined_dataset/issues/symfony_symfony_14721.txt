This pull request adds support for a configurable user checker per firewall. An example could be:
services:
    app.user_checker:
        class: App\Security\UserChecker
        arguments:
            - "@request_stack"

security:
    firewalls:
        secured_area:
            pattern: ^/
            anonymous: ~
            basic_auth: ~
            user_checker: app.user_checker

The above example will use the UserChecker defined as app.user_checker. If the user_checker option is left empty, security.user_checker will  be used. If the user_checkers option is not defined, it will fall back to the original behavior to not break backwards compatibility and will validate using the existing UserChecker: security.user_checker.
I left the default argument in the service definitions to be security.user_checker to include backwards compatibility for people who for some reason don't have the extension executed. You can obtain the checker for a specific firewall by appending the firewall name to it. For the firewall secured_area, this would be security.user_checker.secured_area.
