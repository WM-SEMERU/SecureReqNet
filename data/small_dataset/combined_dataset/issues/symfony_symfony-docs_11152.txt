Making projects using Symfony page searchable


I was looking at the page https://symfony.com/projects, and it would be good if there was a search feature on the page. I notice when you go into a project, it has the components in Symfony that are used, so would be nice to have an option to tick the ones you want and see projects using all of them.
It would also be nice to have a feature of projects that only use Symfony components, or something along the lines of if it was built on skeleton or website-skeleton or something, as well as if it is opensource.
If this was done, it would mean when I want to do a Symfony project, I could search for opensource projects on the skeleton I am using and see how they do certain things etc which would be very useful. Any chance of a feature anything like this?
