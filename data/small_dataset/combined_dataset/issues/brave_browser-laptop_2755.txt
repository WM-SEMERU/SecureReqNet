original issue text
if you open https://jsfiddle.net/s4oab7yn/ and then switch to another tab, the alert shows looks like it's coming from the currently-active tab instead of the tab it's actually from.
two mitigations:

 the message box should display its origin
 add a button in the message box to switch to the tab that it originated from
 also mentioned in #4992 - remove the Brave logo from the alert box
