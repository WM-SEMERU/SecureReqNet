Domado TameNodeList allowing undefined values for keys > length.


Original issue 1892 created by james.keane@wishabi.com on 2014-02-19T01:57:16.000Z:
This is causing a bug in zepto.js: madrobby/zepto#927
Attached is a screen shot of what I am talking about, if you notice the native browser behaviour is to never have a property/index that points to undefined but Domado (ArrayLike?) does.
Looks like it is a simple case of setting undefined vs using delete.
In the screenshot everything except the first two nodes are undefined.
