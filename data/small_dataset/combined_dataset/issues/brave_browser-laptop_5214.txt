show about:blank in urlbar



 Submitted a ticket for my issue if one did not already exist.
 Used Github auto-closing keywords in the commit message.
 Added/updated tests for this change (for new code or code which already has tests).
 Ran git rebase -i to squash commits (if needed).

Auditors: @bbondy
Test Plan:

go to about:blank, observe that it is shown in the urlbar
highlight urlbar and go to about:newtab, observe that it is now empty
