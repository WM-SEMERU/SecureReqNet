Inaccurate statement about Panopticlick


In https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protection-Mode, there is an inaccurate statement about Panopticlick:

Panopticlick also compares you against old browsers. For instance, if the plurality of Panopticlick visits were from people using Firefox 3 many years ago, then a person using Firefox 3 could appear as not-very-identifiable even though there are extremely few Firefox 3 users on the web in 2017 (or at least one would hope).

Panopticlick results are epoched.  We only measure your browser against other browsers we've observed in the last 45 days.  This has been true since 2015.
