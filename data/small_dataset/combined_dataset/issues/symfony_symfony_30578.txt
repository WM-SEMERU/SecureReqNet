Introduce custom attributes for Responses


Description
The request object have attributes property where application can save custom informations. This possibility is missing on responses. (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.php#L74)
I am migrating currently a project that uses ZF1 Request and Response object. The Response object has a method to set exceptions to this Response. Since I want to replace only the Request and Response object I have to support that also as Response object from the HttpFoundation.
So my idea was to add that property also to the Response object
I would also create a PR for that :)
Example
$response= new Response();
$response->attributes->set('something', true);
