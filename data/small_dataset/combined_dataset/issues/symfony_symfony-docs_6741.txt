Delete or improve "How to Simulate Authentication with a Token in a Functional Test" article


I propose to delete the "How to Simulate Authentication with a Token in a Functional Test" cookbook article:

It's an alternative of "How to Simulate HTTP Authentication in a Functional Test", but it doesn't explain when to use this or the other technique.
At the bottom, it says "The technique described in How to Simulate HTTP Authentication in a Functional Test is cleaner and therefore the preferred way." Why should we document something that's not recommended?
The technique doesn't look clean at all.
