[Security][Firewall] Why firewalls are not merged as other security elements?


I made a bundle to handle all the various user management needs common to several websites. The bundle contains a security boilerplate configuration ready to import. The problem is: with this setup I can only have a single main firewall. If I want to add a second one (for example a service that exposes an api with a different user provider) I obtain the message "You are not allowed to define new elements for path "security.firewalls". Please define all elements for this path in one config file".
What are the technical reasons for this choice? It should be farly simple to enable this feature.
