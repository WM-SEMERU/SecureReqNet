warn: go-bindata repo was recreated


Hi!
Use of go-bindata could be dangerous according to this tweet:

go-bindata creator deleted their @github account and someone else created a new account with the same name. There's no guarantees that the new user has good intentions, so if you're using the repository make sure you verify it first!

At least in listed in GOTOOLS variable and built with tools target in GNUMakefile.
Cheers.
