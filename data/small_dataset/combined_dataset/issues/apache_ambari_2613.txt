AMBARI-24894. Sensitive service configuration values should be decrypted when processing the Ambari agent command script, if enabled (amagyar)


What changes were proposed in this pull request?
The sensitive data in ambari-agent config updates should be encrypted. The ambari-server generates an encrpytion key which is stored persistently in the credential store.

This key is used to encrypt the sesntive data. See:  AgentConfigUpdateEncryptor.java
The key is shared with ambari-agent in a stomp message. See: HeartBeatHandler.java
The key is stored in the memory of the ambari-agent. See: EncryptionKeyListener.py
Decryption happens on the agent side. See: config_dictionary.py

The python 3rd party crypto library (pycryptodome) is not yet added to this PR.
How was this patch tested?
