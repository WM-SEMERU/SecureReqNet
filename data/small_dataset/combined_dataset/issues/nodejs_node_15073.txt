Why do you trust CNNIC?



Subsystem: tls


CNNIC has made tons of malware
CNNIC has issued cert for possible MiTM attempt (distrust from Mozilla & Google)
CNNIC has once banned personal registration for it's own profit (& political power)
CNNIC has recalled several registered .cn domains arbitrarily for no prior acknowledgement from domains' owners (because domain name is same as names of Chinese athletes in 2008 Olympics)

You really shouldn't trust CNNIC.
