Some more pose fixes


Based on #23164
This:

Adds support for position-disabled
Adds approximate support for floor-level
Makes transform.inverse.inverse return the original transform
(immersive-web/webxr#576)

To support floor-level properly we have to decompose the sitting_to_standing_transform matrix. I'll have to add decomposition to euclid to do this, sadly.
It may be possible to reuse the decomposition code in servo's style crate, but there's a chance that that's written with column vector style, given that it reflects the CSS transforms spec, which is also written in column vector style. Ugh.
