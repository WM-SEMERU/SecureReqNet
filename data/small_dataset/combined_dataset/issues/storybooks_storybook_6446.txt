Remove deprecated info on Theme's doc


From storybook v5, name and url are deprecated and moved to theme object with brandTitle, brandUrl. It is working now since name, url are backward compatibility until 6.0.    It would be better if it is removed from the doc for less confusion.
What I did
I removed name  key/value on arguments of addParameter()
