Add a new authentication listener allowing to login by sending a JSON document like:
{"_username": "dunglas", "_password": "foo"}.
It is similar to the traditional form login (but take a JSON document as entry) and is convenient for APIs, especially used in combination with JWT.
See api-platform/core#563 and lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle#123 (comment) for previous discussions.

 Add functional tests in security bundle
