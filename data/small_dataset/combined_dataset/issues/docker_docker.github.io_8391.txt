Update running_ssh_service.md


Proposed changes
The Dockerfile here specifies a static root password, screencast. Hard-coding this password into the container creates a security issue; if the container is bridged to the internet, either via NAT or a badly-configured hosting service, it becomes an easy target for attackers.
This change goes some way towards fixing this by specifying that readers should generate a random password before building this image; however, this is a temporary solution. Long term, we need to determine how to wrap this Dockerfile in something that generates a random password at build time.
