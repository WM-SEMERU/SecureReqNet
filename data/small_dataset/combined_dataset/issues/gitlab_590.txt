Webhooks are useful for a lot of stuff, but I'm missing the ability to see the output of the webhook after each push.

There are a few options to fix this:

.

a) Trigger the webhook but wait for the server to reply and then output the reply to the user that did the push.

b) Implement "normal" hooks so we can write some scripts that would be ran before/after each push.

c) Add the email of the user in the JSON payload so a webhook can send the output to the user's email.

.

The third one is the easiest.

.

The first one will work as a drop-in replacement for current behavior and won't require changes, but there might be one big "but". If a server is taking a long period of time to finish the work, the user will be stuck at the "git push" shell.

The second one would be hard to implement, but it's probably the right way to do it.
