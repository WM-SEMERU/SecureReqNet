[DX] New service to simplify password encoding


Encoding a user's password currently looks like this:
$encoder = $this->container->get('security.encoder_factory')
    ->getEncoder($user)
;

$encoded = $encoder->encodePassword($plainPassword, $user->getSalt());

$user->setPassword($encoded);
I'd like to make this easier. How about:
$encoded = $this->container->get('security.password_encoder')
    ->encodePassword($user, $plainPassword);

$user->setPassword($encoded);
The security.password_encoder would be a new service. It would use the $user to get the correct encoder and the getSalt method (which is on UserInterface to get the salt. Done! Hopefully I'm not overlooking anything :).
Thanks!
