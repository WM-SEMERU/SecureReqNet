Parse YAML file and inject it at build time


Description
I saw many application with YAML parsing at runtime. I think we could help people with that, by parsing the file for them and inject the result instead.
Example
services:
    Foo\Bar:
        arguments:
            - !php/yaml path/to/yaml
WDYT ?
