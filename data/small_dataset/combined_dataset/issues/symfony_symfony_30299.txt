[Security] Validate IPs in Access Control


Description
The feature to use access_control for IP validation is very convenient. However it doesn't validate IPs, which may lead to confusing debugging scenarios (e.g. #30298)
Example
Putting anything that it's not an IP or a subnet mask should result in an exception.
