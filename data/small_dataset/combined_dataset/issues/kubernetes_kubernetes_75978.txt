systemUUID is not set on Windows


What happened:
The windows kubelet does not set .status.nodeInfo.systemUUID on the node object.
What you expected to happen:
The windows kubelet sets the systemUUID from wmic csproduct get UUID
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Start the windows kubelet and check for UUID:
kubectl get nodes -o json | jq '.items[]|[.metadata.name, .status.nodeInfo.systemUUID]'

Anything else we need to know?:
This will affect users running the out-of-tree vsphere CCM since that depends on the systemUUID, unlike the in-tree version.
Also, looks like cAdvisor is the component responsible for providing the systemUUID so let me know if this issue needs to be moved to that repo.
Environment:

Kubernetes version (use kubectl version):
Verified on 1.13.1 and 1.14
Cloud provider or hardware configuration:
None
OS (e.g: cat /etc/os-release):
Windows Server 2019
