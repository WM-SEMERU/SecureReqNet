Complete breach due to <script>.innerText


Original issue 1384 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2011-07-20T20:51:07.000Z:
It is possible to break our protection of the contents of <script> elements by using .innerText or (in theory) .innerHTML to access them. For example, cajoling the following in the playground will alert:
<script>
var s = document.createElement('script');
s.innerText="alert('Oh dear.')";
document.body.appendChild(s);
</script>
The cause is that .innerText and .innerHTML test the editable flag rather than the childrenEditable flag, whereas the taming of <script> expects that childrenEditable protects the script text.
I have prepared and tested a fix and will have it reviewed ASAP.
