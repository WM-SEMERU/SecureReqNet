PSP RunAsGroup Doc is incorrect


What happened: Followed the documentation on PSP RunAsGroup rules to limit group Id's to non-superuser (root) using the MustRunAsNonRoot rule. The creation attempt failed with:
The PodSecurityPolicy \"ibm-restricted-psp\" is invalid: spec.runAsGroup.rule: Unsupported value: \"MustRunAsNonRoot\": supported values: \"MustRunAs\", \"RunAsAny\", \"MayRunAs\"" 

From PSP yaml:
  runAsGroup:
    rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'

What you expected to happen: Successfully create a new PSP for non-superuser (root) group privileges using available rule values (which actually seems to be MustRunAs, MayRunAs, RunAsAny according the the api code)
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible): Attempt to create a PSP with a RunAsGroup rule set to MustRunAsNonRoot
Anything else we need to know?: I don't think so
