[Form] placeholder HTML attribute throws warning and missing message translation in profiler


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4
Description
Using a translated value for the placeholder HTML-attribute in form builder, results in warnings and missing message errors in the profiler because the translated value is not found as a translation key.
Placeholder automatically translates the given value and interprets it as a translation key. But what if I want to use a translation domain? Different to the domain label uses? Or if I have variables filled in the translation?
How to reproduce
given another_domain_than_label_below.yml:
foo:
    bar: '%foo% placeholder'
given formbuilder:
$builder->add(
            'foo',
            FooType::class,
            [
                'attr' => [
                    'placeholder' => $this->translator->trans(
                        'foo.bar',
                        [
                            '%foo%' => 'test'
                        ],
                        'another_domain_than_label_below'
                    ),
                ],
                'label' => 'foo.label',
                'translation_domain' => 'label_domain',
                ...
            ]
        );
This will result in a Translation not found. warning as well as a Missing Message where tries to find the message ID "test placeholder" (given the example above). He is translating the already translated values.
This also occurs if try to do this in Twig:
{{ form_widget(form.foo, {
                        "attr": {
                            ...
                            "placeholder": "foo.bar"|trans({
                                '%foo%' : test
                            })
                        }
                    }) }}
Also tried with {% set foo ... before and setting the value directly. Still the warning pops up in the profiler.
Sure it is possible if I just use the translation key foo.bar but that way I can't set the variables as well as the different translation domain.
Possible Solution
Allow to not automatically translate the placeholder value. Let us enter a normal string instead of always trying to translate it.
By the way, the rendered html as well as the translation are correct, just the warnings and missing messages in the profiler are annoying
