Kubelet Bandwidth Limiting Not Working


What happened:
I tried to set up bandwidth limiting by booting a cluster with kops, which by default sets up kubenet. I used the annotations
- kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth: xM
- kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth: xM

and then used iperf3 to test the ingress and egress bandwidths, with no effect.
Does anyone know if this feature is still supported in kubenet? And if so what are the steps I need to take to boot a cluster that can use pod annotations to do tc shaping.
What you expected to happen:
Per #2856 traffic shaping should be implemented on Kubenet as of 4/12/2018.
Anything else we need to know?:
There are a lot of issues regarding traffic shaping not working. None have a concrete answer of how to get it to work on kubenet:

#2856
#41471

Relevant:

PR #11988 I believe this is where it was first implemented.

Environment:

Kubernetes version (use kubectl version): 1.11.8
Cloud provider or hardware configuration: AWS
