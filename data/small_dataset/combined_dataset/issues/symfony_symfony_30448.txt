Implementation of feature request #26714
Finder::ignoreVCS() is great at ignoring file patterns for the files created by popular VCS systems.
However, it would be great to be able to instruct Finder to actually exclude the paths excluded by .gitignore.
So if we have .gitignore:
vendor/
cache/
Finder::create()
->files()
->ignoreVCS(true) // <--- Ignores .git
->ignoreVCSIgnored(true); // <--- Ignores vendor/ and cache/
