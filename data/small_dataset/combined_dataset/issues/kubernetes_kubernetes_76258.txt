Extend the criStatsProvider to collect more metrics


What would you like to be added:
Supplement some metrics into cri stats, such as network info, maxUsage of Memory, CPU scheduling related metrics, etc.
We will extend the cri interface, and add the definitions of monitoring data. Then modify the criStatsProvider.
Why is this needed:
With the development of security runtime, the metrics provided by cri stats currently are not enough for enterprise production. After the supplement, users will get the detail info about pods and containers.
Recently, we gradually start using kata and gvisor to run our applications. However we can not collect the metrics about containers and pods with a unified entrance in the kubelet level, such as network metrics, maxUsage of Memory, CPU scheduling related metrics, etc. Without these metrics, we can not monitor the pods and containers well. It will directly influence the service quality we provide on the Kubernetes.
So we want to provide a unified entrance to collect the runtime metrics. It is sure that we hope our solution is satisfied with community standard and overall tendency.
Sincerely looking forward to some guidance from the Kubernetes community.
