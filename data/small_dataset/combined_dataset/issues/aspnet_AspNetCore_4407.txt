Documentation on OpenIdConnectOptions.RemoteSignOutPath is really misleading


Describe the bug
Documentation on OpenIdConnectOptions is really misleading.
The documentation says:
this path will cause the handler to invoke SignOut using the SignInScheme
However the implementation of the handler says:
await Context.SignOutAsync(*Options.SignOutScheme*);
