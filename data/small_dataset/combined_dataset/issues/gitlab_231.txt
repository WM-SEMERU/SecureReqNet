Gitlab 6.7.5 wiki page gives error 500 instead of wiki editing page.

The wiki page on the web gui gave error 500 every time I clicked it on the project page of Gitlab web gui (6.7.5). Whether the project was empty or not, didn't matter. I've found, based on the production.log, that there was an incorrect line in `/home/git/gitlab/app/models/gollum_wiki.rb`, and modifying it solved the issue.

Line 44 of the file originaly contained:

    rescue Grit::NoSuchPathError

I've changed it to:

    rescue Gollum::NoSuchPathError

And now the wiki page works as it should.


production.log output of the error:

```

  Parameters: {"project_id"=>"$username/$project", "id"=>"home"}

(I have removed a few lines from the check which included projectnames and usernames, but there were no errors in any of them)
