Should deleteFieldEntirely() also delete own grant flag properties?


Original issue 417 created by erights on 2008-06-09T01:30:23.000Z:
deleteFieldEntirely() used to delete all the internal properties associated
with a deleted Caja property. It now deletes only the fastpath flags,
leaving the grant flags when these are different (grantSet and grantCall).
Should these be deleted too? Probably. Do we currently have a security risk
because they aren't? Probably.
