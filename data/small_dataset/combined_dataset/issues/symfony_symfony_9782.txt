I often use type casting and __toString() to print my users as this lets me very easily keep one canonical format for their representation. In functional tests however, it is easier to use in-memory users but this defaults to instances of the core User object. Because these don't have a string representation all the nice type casting crashes.
Hence I propose to represent the core Users by their username string by default. It would be useful in a lot of cases and I can't see any harm in it?
