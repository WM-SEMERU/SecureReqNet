Impersonate an user when using REMOTE_USER


When switching user when you're using the REMOTE_USER setup, it will switch you back every time within a couple of seconds. It's not possible to swich user this way.
Tried to overwrite the security token etc. but that also ends in the same result.
The "impersonated" user does get an updated last login time (FOSUserBundle) in both situations, but the REMOTE_USER is still leading and I am still myself :-)
Anyone facing this issue?
Would be great to use Symfony's switch feature.
