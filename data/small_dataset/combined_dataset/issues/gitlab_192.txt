Sorry for the confusing title, didn't know how to put it. I found an interesting bug. Tested on GitLab Cloud.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a branch named after this regex: `^[a-z]?\d{6,}*` (start with zero or one length string, followed by at least 6 digits, then anything)
2. Push and create an MR.
3. Give title ***same*** as branch name (case sensitive).
4. Go to MR index page.
5. Click on MR link.

You should be directed to the MR, but you go to that commit of the branch instead. I created a test repo: https://gitlab.com/axil/dude/merge_requests

MRs 4-8 are buggy. Notice that 7 and 8 although different names, they point to the same commit.
