I've just created a new project, but I can't push to or clone from it.

The error:

> fatal: '/mnt/ebs/repositories/hunz/trtlrs.git' does not appear to be a git repository
> fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
> 
> Please make sure you have the correct access rights
> and the repository exists.

I've tried removing and recreating the project 3 times, even with different names.
