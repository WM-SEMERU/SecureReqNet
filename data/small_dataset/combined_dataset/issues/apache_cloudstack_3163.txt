systemd: fix services to allow TLS configurations via java.security.ciphers


This fixes the management server and systemd services to allow the
java.security.ciphers file to configure disabled TLS protocols and
algorithms. This also cleans up systemd service files for agent and
usage server, and deprecates use of jsvc when systemd can be used
directly.
This fixes #3140

How Has This Been Tested?
