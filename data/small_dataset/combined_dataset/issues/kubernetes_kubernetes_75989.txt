[e2e] decouple the aggregated clientset from the e2e testing framework


What this PR does / why we need it:

EXPERIMENTAL / awaiting feedback
/hold

Remove usage of the aggregated clientset in the e2e testing framework
itself. We have one test that consumes the clientset in the suite
and it's in test/e2e/apimachinery/aggregator.go, which was recently
promoted to conformance in 8101b86.
This test now obtains a local copy of the aggregated clientset.
