syscall: guard against Windows DLL preloading attacks


Taru Karttunen noted that Go should be more paranoid by default when loading DLLs.
Background:

Microsoft's guidelines:

LoadLibraryEx docs:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684179(v=vs.85).aspx
@rsc proposed:


Change syscall.LoadDLL to call LoadLibraryEx with flags=LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32 instead of calling LoadLibrary. That is, LoadDLL is now secure by default and cannot load DLLs from the directory containing the executable.
Add a LoadLibraryEx to x/sys/win so that users can still get at the old behavior if they want it (by appropriate passing of flags).


CL forthcoming.
