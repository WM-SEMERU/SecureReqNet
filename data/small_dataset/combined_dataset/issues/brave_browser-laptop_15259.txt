Address bar dropdown selects item under mouse position before mouse moves


Description
When I start typing in the address bar, say, "github.com", my mouse cursor selects the option directly under it if my mouse is below the address bar, causing the "Enter" key to go to not github.com, but rather some random github page that I've been to before.
It took me a while to actually understand what's going on here, and my current workaround is just to move the mouse off the browser window before I use the address bar. This is frustrating.
Steps to Reproduce

In Brave, move your mouse cursor about 200 pixels below the address bar
Type github.com

Actual result:
Notice that the third or fourth option of the address bar dropdown is selected. Pressing enter brings you here instead of github.com.
Expected result:
I would expect this item to not be selected until the mouse cursor moves.
Reproduces how often:
You can always reproduce this by following the above steps.
