Third-level objects in SES environment are not frozen


Original issue 1623 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-01-16T23:04:09.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
r5215, Chrome 26.0.1383.0 canary or Firefox 17.0.1 (does not appear to be browser-specific)
What steps will reproduce the problem?
> Object.isExtensible(Array.prototype.some)
true
> Array.prototype.some.foo = 1
1
> Array.prototype.some.foo
1
> cajaVM.sharedImports.Array.prototype.some.foo
1
What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect everything reachable from sharedImports to be frozen, and this is not the case for Array.prototype.some. This problem appears to occur for all of the properties of Array.prototype, Function.prototype, and String.prototype.
This can at least be used to establish communication between guests, and may be a complete breach by way of modifying prototypes of the taming frame.
