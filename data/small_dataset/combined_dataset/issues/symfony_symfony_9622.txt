I agreed with the point raised in #8510 that if the user's account is locked we should no longer attempt to authenticate them, assuming that account locking in this case is a response to too many failed login attempts. A malicious user should be prevented from authenticating if they are attempting a brute force attack.
This PR implements the change suggested by @mmucklo in that issue, and updates the UserChecker class' tests appropriately.
