Throwing errors in console about depreciation


Look I'm not sure what this is exactly, but it's loading on my page(It appears to be part of base.js from youtube?), and it's throwing this error:
SVG's SMIL animations (< animate >, < set >, etc.) are deprecated and will be removed. Please use CSS animations or Web animations instead.
