How to reproduce:

1. Open the list of group milestones view (```/groups/<group>/milestones```)
2. Open a milestone view (```/groups/<group>/milestones/<milestone>?title=<title>```)
3. The milestone descriptions are not rendered the same way than in ```/<group>/<project>/milestones/<id>``` view

It would seem that the descriptions in group milestones are not parsed by Gitlab markdown parser. 

It bug is present in GitLab 7.1.0 (1ddca46)
