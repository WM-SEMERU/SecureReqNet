Side Channel attacks in JS

Is this report about the crypto library or the extension?
Crypto library?
What is the security bug?
Someone brought up your JS implementation of curve25519 in a WhisperSystems ticket on their own misgivings regarding using JS for their curve25519 implementation:
signalapp/Signal-Desktop#42 (comment)
They are of the opinion that an emscripten port would preserve the anti-sidechannel coding patterns of the original C than a JS-native implementation which would get optimized by the JIT.
I figured this would be a problem that you are interested in solving as well.
How would someone exploit it?
Lasers and ... not sharks. Sharks live in saltwater and would just fry the computer. Maybe ferrets with lasers attached to their head?
