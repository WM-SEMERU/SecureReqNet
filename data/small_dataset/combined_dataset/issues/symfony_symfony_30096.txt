Same as #30046, with same comment: I'm unable to provide a reproducer for this, the required service reference graph is too crazy.
This change produces the following diff in the generated getDoctrine_Orm_DefaultEntityManagerService.php file:
37a38,42
> $d = ($this->services['doctrine.orm.default_entity_listener_resolver'] ?? $this->load('getDoctrine_Orm_DefaultEntityListenerResolverService.php'));
> 
> if (isset($this->services['doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager'])) {
>     return $this->services['doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager'];
> }
51c56
< $a->setEntityListenerResolver(($this->services['doctrine.orm.default_entity_listener_resolver'] ?? $this->load('getDoctrine_Orm_DefaultEntityListenerResolverService.php')));
---
> $a->setEntityListenerResolver($d);
@ro0NL if you're up to reducing your reproducer at https://github.com/ro0NL/sf to a simpler one that we could add to the test suite, that'd be awesome!
If not, could you please rename it eg https://github.com/ro0NL/symfony-issue-30091 and keep it around?
