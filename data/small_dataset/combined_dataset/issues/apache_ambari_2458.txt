AMBARI-24742. Encrypting/decrypting PASSWORD type properties when inserting them into the DB/using them


What changes were proposed in this pull request?
Sensitive service configuration values should be encrypted in the Ambari server DB, if enabled.
Sensitive service configuration values are defined by a service's configuration metadata. Properties are defined in XML files under the service's definition directory and contain attributes that Ambari may use to determine whether they should be encrypted or not.
Currently, Ambari uses the property-type attribute to determine the type of property. If the value of this attribute is PASSWORD, than the value is considered sensitive and should be encrypted.
The Ambari server should encrypt sensitive configuration values if the following has been met:

A master key has been setup using the ambari-server setup-security CLI (using option #2 - Encrypt passwords stored in ambari.properties file)
The Ambari server configuration property named server.security.encrypt_sensitive_data is set to true

After creating a new ssl-server configuration:
