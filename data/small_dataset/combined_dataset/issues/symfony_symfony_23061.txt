This would fix problem in scenario when:
in security.yml default_target_path is set to some route
user uses login form without referer
currently he would be incorrectly redirected to login page
after this fix he would be redirected to default_target_path value
generateUri always returns absolute URL (with host),
while parse_url($targetUrl, PHP_URL_PATH) is only returning path (without host)
so entire statement will always evaluate to true, and never to false:
parse_url($targetUrl, PHP_URL_PATH) !== $this->httpUtils->generateUri($request, $this->options['login_path'])

Worked correctly in 3.2, broken by commit: bafa8e2
