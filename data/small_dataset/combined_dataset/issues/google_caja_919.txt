What steps will reproduce the problem?

parent.location.href="http://www.cnn.com";

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The above makes the parent redirect to a different page. This can be used
to redirect to a phishing page.
What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Tested on the caja test page located here: http://cajadores.com/demos/testbed/
