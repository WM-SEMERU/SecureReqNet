Form::EMAIL not accept valid email address


Hi,
I have a problem with validation email address, when address contains dot before at - char.
tonda.@domain.com - this address will not be validate, although it is correct and functional.
I use Form::EMAIL validation rule on  Nette\Forms\Controls\TextInput object. Last version of nette.
I don't know why somebody use this email address, but he is use it. I solve this problem with pattern, but it is not practical.
Thanks for solve.
