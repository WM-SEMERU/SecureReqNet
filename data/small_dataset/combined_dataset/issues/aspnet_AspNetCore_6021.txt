HTTP 404 when redirecting to the AccessDenied page


Functional impact
When accessing a page with no access permissions, an HTTP 404 error is returned (after an HTTP 302 redirect to an invalid location) instead of the AccessDenied page.
Minimal repro steps

Set up a simple project using the ASP.NET Core 2.1 MVC template and add Azure AD authentication.
Annotate a controller action with some dummy role requirement that won't be fulfilled (e.g. HomeController.Contact).
Launch, navigate to the annotated action (e.g. Home/Contact)
An HTTP 302 is returned, redirecting to /Account/AccessDenied, missing the /AzureAD prefix.

Expected result
An HTTP 302 redirecting to /AzureAD/Account/AccessDenied
Actual result
An HTTP 302 redirecting to /Account/AccessDenied
Further technical details
CookieAuthentication Login, Logout and AccessDeniedPath properties are not updated to reflect the new /AzureAD/ area due to a bug in the CookieOptionsConfiguration class.
When configuring CookieAuthenticationOptions, the scheme name is compared with the OpenIdConnectScheme name instead of the CookieScheme name.
This check causes the  GetAzureADScheme method to return null and to skip the CookieAuthenticationOptions configuration.
