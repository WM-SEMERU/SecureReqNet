Description
On starting Atom and on performing certain actions like searching for new packages or even just opening the package manager, my antivirus (360 total security) reports that a trojan has been detected.
After adding the patchwatcher.node file to my antivirus whitelist and restarting Atom, the problem went away. I think it might be worth looking into, though.
Steps to Reproduce

If you have 360 total security installed, launch Atom
If you haven't already seen the alert, try to install a new package from the package manager

Expected behavior: [What you expected to happen]
When I search for a package, I expect to see results.
Actual behavior: [What actually happened]
A trojan alert is displayed by my antivirus and I do not see my search results afterwards.
Versions
Atom 1.10.2
