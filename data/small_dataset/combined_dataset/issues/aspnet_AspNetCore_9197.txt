Intellisense/aspnetcore not allowing void -> object casting


Describe the bug
When using ActionResult<object> as a result, the resulting method allows for the return of void from another function, but it shouldn't, as this gives a ProgramException.
I dont know if this is a Roslyn bug or AspNetCore bug.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Using this version of ASP.NET Core 2.2
Run this code

        private void ReturnVoid() { }


        public ActionResult<object> FaultyMethod()
        {
            return ReturnVoid();
        }

With these argumentsx
See error ProgramException

Expected behavior
It should return an EmptyResult to the end user. Or give an error in intellisense/Roslyn that this sort of thing should not happen.
Or am I missing something here?
