network: Offerings do not have to have Security Grouping enabled


Description
Offerings can co-exist where on does provide Security Grouping in the
network, but other guest Networks have no Security Grouping.
In V(X)LAN isolation environments the L2 separation is handled by V(X)LAN
and protection between Instances is handled by Security Grouping.
There are multiple scenarios possible where one network has Security Grouping
enabled because that is required in that network.
In the other network, but in the same zone it could be a choice to have
Security Grouping disabled and allow all traffic to flow.
Types of changes

 Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)

How Has This Been Tested?
Tested on a Local KVM cloud where VXLAN isolation was being used.
Observed that VMs deployed in the first network have SG enabled and in a other network have it disabled.
