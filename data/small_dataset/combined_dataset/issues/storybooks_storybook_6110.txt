@storybook/addon-storyshots: NPM Audit warning - braces >= 2.3.1


When running NPM / yarn audit throws Regular Expression Denial of Service.
In yarn this is a bit worse because it fails with process code 1 and thus CI.
The following path of dependencies depicts the root origin of the error:
@storybook/addon-storyshots > jest-specific-snapshot >  jest-snapshot > jest-message-util > micromatch > braces

Most libraries have gotten rid of this vulnerability from braces.
Steps to reproduce
Install latest @storybook/framework and @storybook/addon-storyshots and run NPM audit.
Please specify which version of Storybook and optionally any affected addons that you're running
Affected platforms
I'm on macOS but I don't see why it would be different in another OS.
