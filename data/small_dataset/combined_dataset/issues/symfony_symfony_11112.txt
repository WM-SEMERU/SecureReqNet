[Security] Using form_login FormLoginFactory is called even if a custom factory is used


In my company we use a custom user bundle that provides a custom user entity, user provider, authentication provider, security factory and voter.
Our solutions relies on routes and some other behaviours offered by form_login (login, login_ckeck, logout and default target path), but basically all the rest is custom.
Debugging the login procedure I found out that more calls than expected were made to the repository which load the user data.
Most surprisingly I found that these extra calls were made by FormLoginFactory which shouldn't be called at all given that we use our custom solution.
Debugging further it came out that FormLoginFactory is activated when form_login is present in the security configuration. Now this is already quite confusing, but the most confusing part is that removing form_login, routes, default path and all the rest works flawless and the only thing that gets disable is FormLoginFactory.
I don't know how to interpreter this. Is a bug? Is there something out of place in our solution?
This is our security.yml
