Move buildFileTree into a fileTree reducer


Fixes #533
This patch moves all of the functionality that creates the tree structure out of the FileTree component and into a new fileTree reducer. This includes:

The types for FileNode, DirectoryNode and TreeNode.
The functions getVersionName, getRootPath, recursiveSortInPlace and buildFileTree, all of which are used for generating the tree and were all moved exactly as is.
The FileTree component now gets its tree prop via mapStateToProps from the fileTree reducer.
The FileTree component now has a loadData function which is called from both componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate which checks whether has a value in the tree prop and if not dispatches fileTreeActions.buildTree.
The new fileTree reducer exposes one action: buildTree which accepts a version and stores a tree structure in its state, and one selector: getTree which returns either the tree structure, or undefined if it hasn't been built yet for the requested version.
