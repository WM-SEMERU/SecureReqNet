sync(-staging).brave.com certificate upgrade


This issue will track any issues that happen as a result of upgrading the SSL certificate for sync.brave.com. The current certificate is set to expire in early September, so it needs to be upgraded.
Terraform resources have been modified to allow easy upgrading in the future, although since this is the first use of such a system there might be something unexpected that happens.
sync-staging.brave.com has been set up and tested to ensure that the upgrade goes smoothly.
