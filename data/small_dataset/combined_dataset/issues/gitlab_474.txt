What am I doing:
* Creating a repository via Gitlab, for example `translations`
* Renaming it to `translation` via settings
* Try to push the initial commit from dev machine

What is happening:
* When pushing, it returns an error: `Access denied.`
* In Gitlab's settings everything looks in order.
    * The uri is changed to the new name
    * The name of the repo is the new name
    * The initial page is instructing me to push the first commit, with the new uri 
* The uri which is working is not changed to the new name
