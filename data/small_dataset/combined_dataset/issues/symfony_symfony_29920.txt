Currently, when there is no comment for a tag and another tag after, the detection does not work. Example :
/**
 * @final
 *
 * @author John
 */
class A {

}
AFAIK, those tags must not be in a specific order. That's why we should try to support more cases because we might miss things to report.
Also I do not understand why the regex is not the same for the classes and methods detection. I fixed that too.
I added a lot of cases in the "extends from final class" test and an easy way to add more when needed. Adding them everywhere might be overkill and useless. WDYT ?
I'm considering this as bug fix.
