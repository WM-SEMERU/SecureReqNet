Add Content-Security-Policy to all example pages


Given that people are going to be copy-pasting the examples like http://www.getmdl.io/templates/dashboard/index.html
It would be a nice security best practice to include an optimized Content-Security-Policy for each example.
My NOT optimized policy:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; 
    script-src 'self' https://storage.googleapis.com; 
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://storage.googleapis.com https://fonts.gstatic.com https://fonts.googleapis.com;">
