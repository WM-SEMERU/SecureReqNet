Hello team,

I was going through the methods by which you were sanitizing user input to fix my other 2 stored XSS vulnerabilities namely #116697 and #118024 and suddenly I understood that you filtering mechanisms are not proper and its bypassable. 

### POC:
Here is another Stored XSS based on Markdown: `[click this](JAVASCRIPT:alert(document.domain))`.

### Mitigation:
You are only checking small letter characters, like "javascript", "data" etc.. which can be bypassed using capital letters which is also a proper declaration (like the payload I mentioned above). 

Hope this bug will also get resolved soon ! Thanks !
