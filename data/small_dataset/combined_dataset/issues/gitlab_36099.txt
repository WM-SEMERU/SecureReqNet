'From external security tests, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infrastructure/issues/2438:

- Effort: Trivial
- Impact: High
- Location: HttpHeaders

#### Details

It was found that API responses, unlike most other responses from the Gitlab application, are missing the X-Content-Type-Options (XCTO) header. This allows to use the API responses for various client-side attacks as shown in subsequent findings.

Example API response headers:

```
Server: nginx
Date: Tue, 25 Jul 2017 09:22:09 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
Etag: W/"bb127251e3e48a3927c3ce74b6a53d59"
Vary: Origin
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Request-Id: 76fa97f0-8c61-4d15-9e54-0ee0109b5d3d
X-Runtime: 0.029132
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
```

#### Reproduction Steps

Request anything from the API and observe the response headers.

#### Recommendation

It is recommended to use all HTTP security headers deployed by the website for the API as well. Adding the XCTO response header should not impact the website/API functionality in any way.
