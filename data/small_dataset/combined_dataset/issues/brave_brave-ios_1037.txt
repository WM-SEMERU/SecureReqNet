Add the ability to allow user to increase the font size of a webpage


Description:
I see a lot users pitching to zoom to make the text on the screen bigger.
Independently from the iPhone settings we should have a setting to make the text in the browser bigger.
@jamesmudgett can you help figure out this one?
