Changes to Razor Component pages are not reflected - Preview 3


When I change any page in Component|Pages|index.razor or any other page, save and run, I don't see the new changes.
Steps:
Very easy, just change a page, save it and run it.
Same behavior shows on FF and Chrome.
This is the latest version I'm running.
Update: I changed the counter page to add 2 to each count, and that works. But if I make any changes to static text, do not get updated on the next run.
