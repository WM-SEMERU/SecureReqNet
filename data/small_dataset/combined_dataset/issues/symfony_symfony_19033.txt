Although this PR does not break BC, the change in AbstractToken that relates to setUser functionality is highly volatile and should be thoughtfully inspected for possible regressions.
The flow that causes this bug:

ContextListener L161 sets the refreshed User in the token (while checking and marking the token as not authenticated AbstractToken L112). This as a consequence leads to the fact that the user data from the unserialized session data is lost and cannot be used anymore later on.
After Firewall listener trigger, DaoAuthenticationProvider is invoked. It fetches the user from the token (the already refreshed user) and runs the checks UserAuthenticationProvider 85-87.
The checkPreAuth L85 and checkPostAuth L87 are ok as they use the most recent version of the user (refreshed user). checkAuthentication L86 on the other hand is intended for comparing the old user (from the token) and the new user (the refreshed one), but as the user was overwritten on step 1, this check always returns true (DaoAuthenticationProvider checkAuthentication method).

As a result the user remains logged in although the serialized data from the session he has, contains an old password. After first refresh of the page, his session data is overwritten with fresh data from the refreshed user.
