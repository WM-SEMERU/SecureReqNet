Promote TokenReview to v1


Peer to #40709
We have multiple features that depend on this API:

webhook authentication
kubelet delegated authentication
add-on API server delegated authentication

The API has been in use since 1.3 in beta status (v1beta1) with negligible changes:

Added a status field for reporting errors evaluating the token

This PR promotes the existing v1beta1 API to v1 with no changes
Because the API does not persist data (it is a query/response-style API), there are no data migration concerns.
This positions us to promote the features that depend on this API to stable in 1.7

The authentication.k8s.io API group was promoted to v1
