Caja is filtering ::-ms-clear pseudo element


Original issue 1915 created by admin@kdis.ac.kr on 2014-05-14T15:13:23.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
I am using Google Apps Script HtmlService which Uses Caja.
What steps will reproduce the problem?

In IE-10 & above, when an input element is focused, a pseudo cross appears. To remove this we use CSS inputElemnt::-ms-clear{display:none}
But when I use the same CSS with HTML Service, Caja filters this CSS and Cross remains there.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
When I use inputElemnt::-ms-clear{display:none} , cross should not appear
but it is still there because caja filters this CSS.
Please provide any additional information below.
Please check attached screenshot.
