### Summary

Any project model database column can be controlled on import by fields in the `project.json` of an exported project. 

### Steps to reproduce

Adding `namespace_id` to `project.json` can create a project in any namespace:

1. Export a project using the web UI.
2. Add a field and value such as `"namespace_id": 1"` to the `project.json`.
3. Import the project using the web UI.  This results in a 404, but the project import has created some artifacts.
4. Navigate to `/:importing_user/:project_name/edit` to update the path to complete the import to the target namespace/owner.

This is just 1 example of many of the fields 

This appears to be present in at least 10.7.1-ee Omnibus installs.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Almost any field can be directly assigned by setting a value in the `project.json`.

Before the final move, the project appears configured like this:

![test2___namespace1___Projects___Admin_Area___GitLab_-__Private_Browsing_](/uploads/0e3a9721dafb65e854731095357272dc/test2___namespace1___Projects___Admin_Area___GitLab_-__Private_Browsing_.gif)

### Possible fixes

This appears to attempt to add a test for `Project.column_names`, but is either not working or the values are being added elsewhere:
