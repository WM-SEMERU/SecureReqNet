Well, from the perspective of the dependencies, evaluateUntrustedExternalScript
does what it does because it wants to avoid mitigation on the premise that it
has content which either is already rewritten or doesn't care. On those grounds
the rewriter-or-not-carer should be supplying the relevant options.
More practically, we could have SES export an appropriate options structure for
the no-mitigation goal, which evaluateUntrustedExternalScript then passes back
in.

in the absence of a compiler that checks the enum, it would help
defend against future errors/misspellings/option renames if mitigateOpts was
checked for unexpected own keys.
