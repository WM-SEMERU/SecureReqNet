This new command allows to set ACL directly from the command line. This useful to quickly set up an environment and for debugging / maintenance purpose.
This PR also includes a functional test system for the ACL component. As an example, it is used to test the acl:set command.
The provided entity class is not mandatory (tests will still be green without it) but can be useful to test other ACL related things. I can remove it if necessary.
The instantiation of the MaskBuilder object is done in a separate method to be easily overridable to use a custom one (e.g. the SonataAdmin one).
