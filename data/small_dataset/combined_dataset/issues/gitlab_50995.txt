Hi,

I have found an issue which can be used by an attacker guest user to see branches name and Tags name within project.


POC:
=====

* Create a project with branches and tag names.
* invite a guest user and now log from guest account
* now from guest account visit:
https://gitlab.com/cathaxx/private-caty/refs?search= (https://gitlab.com/username/projectname/refs?search=)

It will show you all your branches(https://gitlab.com/user/project-name/branches) and tag name(https://gitlab.com/user/project-name/tags) in the project , which is normally forbidden.


Let me know if you need any more information or if i missed something.
Thanks
bull

## Impact

Unintended data leakage to guest user.


## Notes from Security Team

~P3/~S3 since similar and more detailed informationÂ is available to guests when `Public Pipelines` are enables.
