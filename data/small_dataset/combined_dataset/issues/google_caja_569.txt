Consider writing domita.js in Caja/Cajita


Original issue 569 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-12T23:42:53.000Z:
Several of the bugs we found in domita.js would have been prevented if it
had been written in Caja or Cajita.  Would it be possible to write it in
Caja or Cajita, and just pass in the authorities it needs when it is
instantiated?
