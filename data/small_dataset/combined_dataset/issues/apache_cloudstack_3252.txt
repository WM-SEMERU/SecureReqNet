COMPONENT NAME

ACS 4.11 CreateLoadBalancerRule API call

CLOUDSTACK VERSION

CONFIGURATION

SUMMARY

Load balancer protocols for UDP and TCP-proxy are not labelled correctly in the GUI:
** 
** Note label is label.lb.protocol_udp / label.lb.protocol_tcp-proxy (underscores used to signify the inserted space)
** Whatever protocol is chosen is persisted in the DB with the above strings.
However HAproxy and iptables configuration will always be configured with "TCP".
This may or may not be down to two protocol parameters here: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/4.11.2.0/api/src/org/apache/cloudstack/api/command/user/loadbalancer/CreateLoadBalancerRuleCmd.java#L316 where the first one is always set to "TCP"

STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Create LB rule using each protocol
Observe the configuration which ends up on the HAproxy configuration on the VR does NOT change and always uses TCP.

EXPECTED RESULTS

Protocols UDP and TCP-proxy being honoured

ACTUAL RESULTS

All LB rules are configured as TCP.
