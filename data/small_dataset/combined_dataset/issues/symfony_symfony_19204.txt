Back to 3.0, one could extend Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\LdapUserProvider and override how User objects are created.
Among several improvements, #17560 changed loadUser signature but also visibility to private which disallow any overriding.
Even if the signature BC break is legitimate, we should still be able to override this method IMHO, which is not possible with a private visibility.
This PRs introduces a protected visibility to allow again overriding.
