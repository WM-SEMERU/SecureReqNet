Fix "How to Change the default Target Path Behavior" article


Article: http://symfony.com/doc/current/security/target_path.html
Problems:

It looks too complex
It uses .class parameters
It assumers that you are using the Symfony Framework (services.yml, AppBundle, etc.) but the article belongs to the components (maybe this is not an error because there's no other way to explain it).
