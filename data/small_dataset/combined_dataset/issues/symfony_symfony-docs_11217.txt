Remove CustomUserMessageAuthenticationException


Remove the use of CustomUserMessageAuthenticationException, as this is not compatible with the @throws tag of the interface.
Since AccountDeletedException is implemented by the user here, they could let it take a custom message.
This statement is only in the 4.2 docs, not the 3.4
