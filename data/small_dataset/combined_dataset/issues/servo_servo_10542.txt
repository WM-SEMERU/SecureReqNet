Use unguessable UUID pipeline ids to prevent spoofing

A compromised iframe process can pretend to be any iframe/pipeline when talking to the constellation, since the constellation channels are shared. This could be used to escalate access out of the sandboxed iframe.
This can either be fixed by separating out the constellation channels (would require selecting over a ton of channels and probably is inefficient), or by making the pipeline id unguessable (currently a u64 counter). A 128-bit uuid should be enough.
