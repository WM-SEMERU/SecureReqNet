x/crypto: cryptobyte: encode int64 with context-specific tags


We frequently have to deal with asn.1 formatted with context-specific
tags even for things like integers, for example:
http://lapo.it/asn1js/#A0108004010203048102050682040708090A
To do that efficiently with cryptobyte I've added two additional
functions to marshal such values to and from int64:
func (b *Builder) AddInt64(tag asn1.Tag, v int64)
func (s *String) ReadASN1Int64(out *int64, tag asn1.Tag) bool
I assume versions for uint64 will also be required.
Does it make sense to add those to the cryptobyte API or is there a workaround?
