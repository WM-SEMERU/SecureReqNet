'### Summary

In a GitLab CE installation (v10.1.0) - I have the server configured to allow signups and to treat new users as `external users`.  Per [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#external-users-permissions) a user who signs up with this should not be able to create projects or groups.  

> They cannot however create groups or projects, and they have the same access as logged out users in all other cases.

However such a user can create repositories and groups.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a GitLab installation (I suppose v10.1.0 would be best to use) - allow for sign ups and check the box for `New users set to external` in `/admin/application_settings`

Register a new user.  Note that the new user is marked as External, but has the user has privileges to create projects and groups.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

External Users should not be able to create projects or groups.

There is a similar ticket #37428 - but this seems to be more broad.  I have oauth2 enabled, but I was able to do this using non-oauth2 registration.
