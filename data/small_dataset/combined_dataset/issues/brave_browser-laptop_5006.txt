From https://hackerone.com/reports/176197
It is possible for a tab to close itself even if the tab was not opened by a script. In Chrome this is blocked with the message Scripts may close only the windows that were opened by it which is controlled by webkit DOMWindow.cpp DOMWindow::close.
Expected behavior:
window.close should only allow a tab to be closed if it was opened by the script
