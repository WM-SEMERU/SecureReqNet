During the recent spam invasion we saw a coincidental uptick in traffic to a repo hosting links to streaming sports events. We had 47K+ unique IPs all hitting the same repo using a private token in 24 hours. This caused a huge performance hit on the database.

GitLab needs an automated way to deny access from too many source IPs within a specified time period. Storing last login IPs in redis with a TTL that gets updated with each login in one option.
