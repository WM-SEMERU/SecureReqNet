ensure input doesn't reach output without sanitization


Original issue 517 created by felix8a on 2008-06-11T22:43:17.000Z:
right now, it's too easy to accidentally pass an unsanitized input node
through the pipeline unchanged and emit it verbatim, which violates the
whitelist principle.
the js stage has a phase that verifies there are no unsanitized nodes at
the end, but there isn't a similar check for html and css nodes.
this could be done with a flag on nodes, but we also discussed a number of
ways of doing this in the type system instead.  a rationale for doing it
with types is it reduces the amount of code that has to be audited to
verify the sandboxing claim.
one proposal is to parameterize Nodes with a class that marks which
lifecycle wave the node belongs to, so you might have
ParseTreeNode<ParsedWave>
where ParsedWave inherits from LifeCycleWave, etc.
and then various transformations would rewrite to Node<NormalizedWave> and
then to Node<SafeWave>.
('wave' is a bad name, but the normal name 'stage' already means something
else.)
