Two finger swipe for backwards/forwards does not work in C69


Description
On macOS you can use a gesture to go backwards and forwards in your page history. This is a two finger swipe which you do to either left or right. If the input is not registering, you can go into Advanced > Swipe Options to adjust the sensitivity
With the Chromium 69 upgrade, this functionality is not working
Steps to Reproduce

Be on a laptop with a trackpad
Open a tab and generate tab history by visiting sites or navigating around one site
Go back in the tab history a few pages so you can go forward or backward
Do two finger swipe from left to right (this should be going back) or right to left (this should be going forward)

Actual result:
Back/Forward arrows get larger to indicate you're trying to navigate, but the page does not change:

Should be able to navigate back and forth as we can on 0.23.104
