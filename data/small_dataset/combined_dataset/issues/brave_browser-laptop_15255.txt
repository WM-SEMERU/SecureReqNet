brave://example gets stuck in a loading loop


Description
Chrome has "chrome://history/" so I assumed brave would have "brave://history/" (it doesn't). This is fine, but when I go to brave://history it just keeps loading and loading. Not a big deal but still a bit strange.
Steps to Reproduce

Copy and paste brave://example in to the brave browser

Actual result:
Never ending loading.
Expected result:
Not really sure, should probably treat it as a search? Eg. on Chrome if you go to "chromeee://history" it'll treat it as a search query.
Reproduces how often:
