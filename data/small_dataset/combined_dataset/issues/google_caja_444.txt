caja.each() should protect against possible plan interference hazard


Original issue 444 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-09T23:45:04.000Z:
caja.each(o, f) can give unexpected results if calling f() can cause side
effects on o.  It's an obligation on the caller of caja.each() to avoid
this situation; failure to respect this obligation may introduce the
possibility of plan interference, which is a potential security hazard.
Arguably, the documentation for caja.each() should warn of this hazard or
should state this obligation on the caller.
