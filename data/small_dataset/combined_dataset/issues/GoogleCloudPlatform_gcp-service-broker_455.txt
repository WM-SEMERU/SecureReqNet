Added ability to load brokerpaks from local FS


The broker will now check /usr/share/gcp-service-broker/builtin-brokerpaks
on startup if GSB_COMPATIBILITY_ENABLE_BUILTIN_BROKERPAKS is set.
This allows us to bundle brokerpaks with the Docker image so users don't
have to download and install builtin paks and/or they can extend with
custom paks.
