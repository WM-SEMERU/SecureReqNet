Build OE libraries with more secure flags


Apply recommended security hardening flags to build of oehostapp and oecore
libs. This includes:

Compile host apps with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and -fstack-protector-strong.
Link both enclaves and host apps with -z,noexecstack.
Link enclaves with -z,now in addition.
Update pkg-config to apply these by default for samples.
Update host and enclave/core CMakeLists.txt to export these flags.
Update CHANGELOG.md to reflect this.

Fixes #1600
