PS7 should also respect the old Windows PowerShell GPO registry settings


Summary of the new feature/enhancement
As part of the side-by-side work for PSCore6, PSCore6 uses a different set of registry paths for GPO policies.  This means admins can set policies separately for Windows PowerShell vs PowerShell Core, but makes it more difficult to manage.
Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
For PowerShell 7, pwsh should look in both paths.
