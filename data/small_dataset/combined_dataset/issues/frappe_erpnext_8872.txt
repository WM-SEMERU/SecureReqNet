Deleting/Closing emails from inbox says 'Insufficient Permissions'


Using ERPNext: v8.0.27 (master)
Frappe Framework: v8.0.44 (master)
To replicate
Set up normal users with email inbox and Super Inbox user role.
Click on an email in email inbox
Click 'close' button near top of record.
Get Insufficient permission' error
To fix
Basically email inbox users also need 'Delete' permission on 'Communication' doctype to make this work, via the role permissions manager.
