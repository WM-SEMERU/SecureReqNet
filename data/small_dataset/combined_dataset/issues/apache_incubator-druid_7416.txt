Remove select execution code from SQL planner


#7373 changed SQL planning to eliminate the use of select queries for time-ordered SQL SELECTs.  This PR removes the code in the SQL planning that executes select queries.  It also removes the druid.sql.planner.selectThreshold config property which is no longer used.
