What is the current behavior?
Angular Versioning and Releases document was last updated in Sept 2018. It's now out of date in two ways:

The release schedule includes the boilerplate months of "March/April" for version 8 and "September/October" for version 9.
The release number examples still use version 5. Not incorrect, just feels old.

Issue Number: N/A
What is the new behavior?
