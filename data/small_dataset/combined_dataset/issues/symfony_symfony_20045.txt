[DX] Define a default encoder for in-memory users


Context
A fresh new Symfony app has the following security configuration (no encoder is defined):
security:

    providers:
        in_memory:
            memory: ~

    firewalls:
        # ...
Problem
If you add some in memory users:
security:

    providers:
        in_memory:
            memory:
                users:
                    admin: { password: 1234 }

    firewalls:
        # ...
You'll see the following error:
No encoder has been configured for account "Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User".

Then you must define the encoder for that "strange" user class provided by Symfony:
security:
    encoders:
        Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User: plaintext

    providers:
        in_memory:
            memory:
                # ...
Solution
Symfony could define plaintext as the default encoder of the in-memory users. This shouldn't be a security issue because developers will always define later the appropriate algorithm for them. But this is a minor DX improvement because it avoids this strange initial error.
