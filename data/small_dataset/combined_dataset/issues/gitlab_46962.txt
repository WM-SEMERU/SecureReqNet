### Description

The current wording for email addresses added to Gitlab accounts states "All emails will be used to identify your commits."  While this is understood for general git usage and included as part of the TOS, recent new features such as #45821 have highlighted that adding an email to an account makes the profile itself searchable by email.

### Proposal

At a minimum, wording on the `Emails` settings page should be updated to include this usage.

API endpoints and UI mechanisms that take email addresses as input such only be able to operate on "Public" email addresses.  This reduces the effectiveness of phishing campaigns against users by requiring manual work to specifically craft message for targets instead of allowing an automated process for discovering email to account and profile names.
