Specify the expected behaviour of all JavaScript constructs used in cajoled code


Original issue 535 created by zestyping on 2008-06-12T06:08:56.000Z:
Many of the bugs discovered so far in the Caja review are due to
mismatches between the expected behaviour of certain JavaScript
constructs and the actual behaviour in particular browsers.
The Caja team should identify all the JavaScript constructs that
can ever come to appear in cajoled code, and document the expected
behaviour of each construct (the behaviour upon which the cajoler
and Caja runtime rely, both in order to produce correct program
behaviour according to Caja semantics, and in order to enforce the
security restrictions between gadgets and within a container).
Such a specification is necessary not only for finding bugs now;
it is also necessary in order to maintain the code moving forward.
Everyone on the team needs to have the same understanding of what
these behavioural expectations are.  When new versions of browsers
come out, you need to be able to agree on whether they violate any
of your previous assumptions.  And as you change the cajoler, you
need to be able to tell whether you've introduced any new constructs
into cajoled code beyond what you've fully understood and specified
up to that point.
