Wrong value set for CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST


CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST should be set to 2 not to 1.
From the libcurl documentation:

When CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST is 2, that certificate must indicate that the
server is the server to which you meant to connect, or the connection fails.
Curl considers the server the intended one when the Common Name field or a
Subject Alternate Name field in the certificate matches the host name in the
URL to which you told Curl to connect.
When the value is 1, the certificate must contain a Common Name field, but it
doesn't matter what name it says. (This is not ordinarily a useful setting).

Thanks for ghedo from debian.org for reporting.
