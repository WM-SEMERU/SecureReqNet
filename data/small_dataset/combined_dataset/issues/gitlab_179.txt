We have Issues with bigger Merge Requests. Scenario is like Following

1. We have a origin repository
2. We add another user with at least Reporter Permissions.
3. User2 forks the repository into an own one (repository2)
4. User 2 pushes a big commit to repository2
4. User2 creates a Merge Request from repository2 to origin repository
5. User1 wants to Review the Commit(s) in Origin Repository
6. User1 won't see the commit(s) due to beeing too big
7. User1 won't be able to download the diff, instead he gets a 404 Errorpage

8. Maybe another Bug: User1 clicks on the commit and is redirected to repository2 without having a membership. He also gets a 404 instead of permission denied or alike.
