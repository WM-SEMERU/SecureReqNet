Reorganize rel='noopener'


Follow-up to #10290
Also:

Add rel='noopener' to brave.com (as the site also may be hacked, which of course should not happen)
Fix a typo on https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/10290/files#diff-53c54a977fb4fffd2f7da96ec29f0c71R18
Always rel='noopener' first, target='_blank' second on the same line (to make it easy to search it with regex)

Test Plan:

Search your repo for target='_blank'
Make sure external anchor links with target='_blank' have rel='noopener'
