keyboard shortcut for previous tab ctrl+shift+tab not working on cr69


Description
When I use the ctrl+shift+tab shortcut to go to the previous tab, it doesn't always work. Sometimes it goes back a tab or two, and then starts going forward. Sometimes it just goes forward. Sometimes it goes forward for several tabs and then alternates between two tabs (goes back and forth on two tabs).
Another shortcut to navigate to previous tab cmd+opt+<- arrow works as expected to go to the previous tab.
Steps to Reproduce

Launch 0.23.201 with a clean profile.
Open a bunch of sites in tabs.
Make a tab somewhere in the middle the active tab.
Use ctrl+shift+tab several times to navigate tabs --> you might go back a tab or two but eventually you start going forward or you go to the next tab (on the right) instead of the previous tab (on the left)

Actual result:
In the below gif I'm using ctrl+shift+tab to navigate between tabs at all times. Using this goes forward in the tabs for a bit and then it gets stuck and alternates between two:

Expected result:
ctrl+shift+tab should go to previous tab (on the left) as cmd+opt+<- arrow does.
