Add option to opt out of using a token **for discovery**


Possible ways to do this:
a) Add a new flag (discovery-(mode|type) for instance) along with a config option
b) Config option only
c) Allow a "magic-value" of --token in kubeadm init
d) ...
I think a) would be the best option.
Why? Because folks will have other ways to move around the cluster information (masters, CA certs, auth token etc.)
@justinsb This one is for you ;)
Everyone doesn't want to expose the cluster-info ConfigMap publicly, and there should be a way to opt out of doing that with kubeadm as well.
Note that a token will still be used for authentication in most cases. This is only for discovery and validation of the master from the node's perspective.
