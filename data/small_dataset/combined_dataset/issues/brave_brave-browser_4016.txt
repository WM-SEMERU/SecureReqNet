Unknown site favicon for few publishers


Description
I have been using the Nightly build as my personal profile for a few days ( since 3 days). I have opened a few YT and Twitch videos along with websites. Around 35 sites got added to a-c table. On the 3rd day, I am seeing unknown site favicon for a few publishers for e.g (Brave.com and Twitch pubs). I have reloaded the brave.com couple of times and correct favicon retained back in a-c table, but for twitch unknown favicon remained unchanged even after the page reload.
