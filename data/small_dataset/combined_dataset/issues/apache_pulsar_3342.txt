Docker compose configuration with TLS


Change adds a docker compose recipe with a zk node, 2 bookies, a
pulsar broker and a proxy node. The proxy and the broker are both
configured to use TLS authentication.
The certs/keys to use to connect are those in
tests/certificate-authority/client-keys. admin is the super user.
