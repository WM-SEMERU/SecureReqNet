Facing TLS handshake timeout exception after setting http proxy while starting minikube


Hi all,
I am trying to start minikube on my bare metal ubuntu 16.04 machine with http proxy. But facing TLS handshake timeout exception while starting.
Command for starting minikube :-
minikube start --docker-env=HTTP_PROXY=$HTTP_PROXY --docker-env HTTPS_PROXY=$HTTPS_PROXY  --docker-env NO_PROXY=$no_proxy --vm-driver=none
$HTTP_PROXY, $HTTPS_PROXY ,$no_proxy etc these variable are having proxy value that is perfectly fine.
Prerequisite for minikube
I have successfully installed docker and able to pull image after adding proxy for docker.
I have tried so many time but always facing below issue
o   minikube v1.0.0 on linux (amd64)

*   Sorry that minikube crashed. If this was unexpected, we would love to hear from you:

Note :- http proxy , https proxy and system ip from above code is hided by me. Do not consider it as an error.
I feel minikube is not able to use this proxy. I need to change some other things as well.
I have added config.json file as well at /root/.docker location.
config.json file content
  "proxies": {
    "default": {
      "httpProxy": "http_proxy_is_confidential",
      "HTTP_PROXY": "http_proxy_is_confidential",
      "NO_PROXY":"127.0.0.1,localhost,system_ip_is_confidential",
      "no_proxy":"127.0.0.1,localhost,system_ip_is_confidential"
    }
  },
  "credsStore" : "pass"
}

Please help me out from this issue.
