Add XRFrame.getPose()


I think I've figured out the model of poses, waiting on Nell for confirmation.
Basically, getViewerPose(p) is equivalent to getPose(source=viewerSpace, relative_to=p)
The eye-level space, for example, is stationary and stuck to the origin. The position-disabled and identity spaces somewhat counterintuitively follow you around (and appear to be stationary from getViewerPose() but not getPose().
The incorrect mental model kinda "works" when looking at only getViewerPose(), but we need to figure it out for getPose().
Todo (may add to this PR, but probably not)

implement XRSession.viewerSpace
implement position-disabled
implement floor-level (hard to test without a 6dof device)
