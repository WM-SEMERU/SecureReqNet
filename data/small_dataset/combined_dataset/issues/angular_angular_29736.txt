Description
Directive routerLinkActive knows when a link is active. Based on that, add "aria-selected=true" attribute to the component.
Describe the solution you'd like
 If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.
RouterLinkActive already takes routerLinkActiveOptions as input. We can extend that to support this new feature.
Describe alternatives you've considered
 Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?
Alternative is to define my own directive based on routerLinkActive, which I may do in the mean time. But I see this as a core accessibility improvement which should be supported natively.
