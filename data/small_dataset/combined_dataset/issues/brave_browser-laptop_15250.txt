Option to disable mixed content does not work for ajax requests


This is somewhat of a followup to #3443. I have searched google for this issue but have not found anything, so I am opening a bug.
Description
I currently have a site that I load via https, and makes an ajax request to another server using http. I cannot change this currently for either site. The option to "load unsafe scripts" does not seem to persist/work for ajax requests at all-when the page reloads, I still get the same error.
Steps to Reproduce

Load an https website
Trigger an http ajax request
Click the lock icon to the left of the URL bar, then click "load unsafe scripts"
The page reloads. Try to trigger the ajax request again.

Actual result:
Look in console and click the lock icon again. The same "load unsafe scripts" option is available, and the same error "cannot load unsafe content" shows up in console.
Expected result:
I would expect the ajax request to now go through. Performing these exact same steps on Google Chrome will allow the ajax request to work.
Reproduces how often:
