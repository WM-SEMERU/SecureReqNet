[2.0] SignIn for cookies should honor AuthenticationProperties.RedirectUri


When calling SignInAsync for the cookie handler, if an AuthenticationProperties with a RedirectUri set is passed it's not honored unless the current path is the same as the LoginPath. If an explicit AuthenticationProperties is passed with a RedirectUri set, then I'd expect it to be honored.
