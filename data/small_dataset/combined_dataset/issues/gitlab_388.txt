When viewing the contents of a commit, the box around a broad image is too small and only a part of it gets the gray background. This occurs in Firefox and not in Chrome/Chromium.

**Steps to reproduce:**

Commit a broad image (I used an image that's almost 1800px broad) and look up the commit in Gitlab. The image appears as one of the committed files.

**Expected behavior:**

I would expect to either:

1. See the entire image scaled down in the surrounding box; or:
2. See the entire image in actual scale, with a horizontal scroll bar, and a continuous gray background.

**Observed behavior:**

In Firefox, the image is shown in actual scale and with a horizontal scroll bar, but the gray background does not continue. Screenshot:

I've observed this behavior in Firefox 30.0 running on Linux Mint 15.

In Chrome this problem does not occur, as in Chrome (Chromium actually) the image is scaled down to fit entirely in the surrounding box.
