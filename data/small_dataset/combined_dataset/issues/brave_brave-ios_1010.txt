brave crashes when attempting to sync into a folder that's opened


Description:
When you're attempting to move a folder from another device into a folder that iOS has opened, the browser will crash once a sync occurs. It will result in the following crash:

Crash Stack from Xcode --> stack.txt


Steps to Reproduce
@btlechowski thank you for narrowing down the STR and proving the following STR:

Clean install on desktop
import the following bookmarks under desktop randomBookmarks.txt <-- rename to .html
Create a new sync chain on desktop once the above bookmarks have been imported
Clean install Brave on iPhone/iPad
Join the sync chain that you created on the desktop with the iOS device
Wait for sync to complete on both devices
On iPhone: Open Sports folder in bookmarks and keep it open (prevent the phone from locking etc)
On Desktop: Move Games bookmark folder to Sports
On iPhone: Wait for sync while keeping Sports folder open

Note: The key is to keep bookmark folder open on iOS when syncing
Actual result: 

Crashes with the following Stack from Xcode --> stack.txt

Expected result:
Application shouldn't be crashing
