It would be nice to have the possibility to define more than one LDAP server, one could do something like this:

```
gitlab.yml

ldap:
  server: ['ldap1.example.com', 'ldap2.example.com', ... ]

```

The authentication should then try the next server in the list when one of the servers does not reply or just takes a random server from the list. Maybe one has to define an additional attribute in the ldap section to define the timeout.
