FlattenException doesn't support undefined value


Symfony version(s) affected: 4
Description
A php exception (Call to a member function x() on null) throws a second exception from flattenexception.
https://github.com/symfony/debug/blob/master/Exception/FlattenException.php#L295
php.WARNING: Notice: Undefined variable: value {"exception":"[object] (ErrorException(code: 0): Notice: Undefined variable: value at vendor/symfony/debug/Exception/FlattenException.php:295)"}
How to reproduce
It happens after an exception
request.CRITICAL: Uncaught PHP Exception Error: "Call to a member function x() on null"
Possible Solution
            if (!isset($value)) {
                $result[$key] = array('null', 'NOT ISSET');
            } elseif ($value instanceof \__PHP_Incomplete_Class) {
Not sure how $value can't be defined as we are in a for loop, maybe a PHP bug ?
