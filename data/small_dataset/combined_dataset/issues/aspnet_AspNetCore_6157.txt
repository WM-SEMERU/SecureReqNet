Add SaveTokens property to AzureADB2COptions


I want to get the id_token of the user who signed in with AzureADB2C.
However, because the SaveTokens property does not exist in the AzureADB2COptions
used in extension method: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AddAzureADB2C().
id_token can not be acquired with HttpContext.GetTokenAsync ("id_token").
Can implement the SaveTokens property like OpenIdConnectOptions?
I think that it is possible, If modify the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI.OpenIdConnectOptionsConfiguration.Configure().
