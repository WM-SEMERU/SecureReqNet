Running Bazel build on Windows with default Execution Policy doesn't work


üêû bug report
Affected Package
This issue is related to running Bazel on Windows.
Is this a regression?
N/A
Description
I checked out Angular and did a fresh yarn install. Once that was done, I tried running one of the package/examples, in this case it was my own example package (for my PR at #29755), which runs fine on the CI.
Once I run my example using yarn bazel run //packages/examples/router/activated-route:devserver, I get the error I mentioned below.
To resolve this, all I had to do was open PowerShell and execute the following command:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

When I now try and run yarn bazel run //packages/examples/router/activated-route:devserver, everything works fine! :)
As this unblocked me, I used this aproach and decided to see if anyone on twitter had a way to solve this.
The friendly @alexeagle replied to my tweet asking if I had an Github issue. I didn't, but now I do üòÑ !
üî¨ Minimal Reproduction
Just run the master on Windows 10 with the default Execution Policy (Resitricted) and run any example mini-app ( ensure to empty your bazel directory with cache etc). If you want to execute the command I've been pasting (yarn bazel run //packages/examples/router/activated-route:devserver), you'll need to run my branch for this PR: #29755

Anything else relevant?
So I'm running on Windows 10, My Execution-Policy is set to its default value.
If any other environmental information is needed, feel free to reach out.
