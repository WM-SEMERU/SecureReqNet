WIP perform config drive creation on primary storage (CLOUDSTACK-10290)


Description
The present configdrive generation happens on secondary storage, which is also used in public facing functionality. For those that wnat it can be processed on primary storage. This will be optional for now as using localstorage will complicate things when migrating.
First phase is factoring out the config drive creation code into a separate project (done)
next it will be made available to the host agent (KVM only)
finally the decision to look for a primary storage to do the processing on will be implemented on the basis of a global setting.
