Caja is using Proxy.create


Original issue 1949 created by evilpies on 2014-12-20T15:19:29.000Z:
While debugging a Firefox crash (bugzil.la/1113980), I came across code that suggests that Caja is still using Proxy.create. We have plans to remove the old API in the future (bugzil.la/892903), so it would be good if Caja started using the new API.
Does Caja work without Proxy.create? Do you have any idea how long replacing Proxy.create is going to take?
Thank you,
Tom
