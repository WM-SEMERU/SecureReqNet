Similar to #23050, when accessing a Data clone property through __get() and the value is null for instance, you'll really get null instead of a Data instance. The solution is to use seek instead whenever we access and try to use profiler_dump on a Data property that can be a simple scalar like null or false. AFAIK, decision.object is the only one here.
