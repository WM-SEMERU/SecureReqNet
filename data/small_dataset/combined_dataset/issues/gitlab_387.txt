As of now, guests can create issues and modify them - most notably assign a different person or milestone. The latter is a problem: Imagine a guest submits an issue he considers super-urgent. The developers have a different opinion and assign it to a later milestone. The guest can change this milestone back again at will, which renders the milestone feature useless for roadmapping since people not involved in development have the right to swirl issues.

My suggestion is to limit guests to only create and view issues. What do you think?

The only modification necessary would be:
