Remove SRI enforcement from the site


SRI turns out to be trouble for 3rd party services that update their JS-include-based API hooks often - e.g. Pontoon, Google Analytics, Optimizely. The hashes change without notice, and SRI's rejection of resources has the potential for major site breakage.
Thought we needed SRI for security requirements, but can't find an email or bug mentioning it. So, since it seems more trouble than it's worth without better tooling (e.g. Issue #1121), let's remove it for now.
