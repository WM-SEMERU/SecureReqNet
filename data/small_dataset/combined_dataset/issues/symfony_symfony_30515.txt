Makes sure deletes when on Predis  Cluster is only done one by one as it's not able to send the keys to right cluster node like RedisCluster can.
This is backport of logic from 4.x to fix this. With one tweak; make sure to only do this when on cluster so not all Predis users pay the penalty for it.
