Authorize spec history instead of current specs for supervisor history API


The auth checks on the /history and /{id}/history endpoints in the SupervisorResource are incorrect, they filter based on the current specs of supervisors, instead of filtering the lists of spec history.
This PR fixes the checks so that they filter the spec history properly.
