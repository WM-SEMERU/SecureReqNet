[Routing] Share configuration between routes


I have a website splitted in 2 areas:

public customers
professional customers

Both areas contains the same organization (a list of the same activities).
I am trying to generate the sames urls for both areas (just adding a prefix on pro area) and share the configuration so I don't need to duplicate all urls.
The goal is to have something looking like this:
Public area:
- /activity-1/
- /activity-2/
- /reuse-same-slug/

Pro area (reuse same slugs without prefix):
- /pro/activity-1/
- /pro/activity-2/
- /pro/reuse-same-slug/

My controllers are stored in 2 distinct folders using same controller names:
App\Controller\Pub\Activity1Controller.php
App\Controller\Pub\Activity2Controller.php

App\Controller\Pro\Activity1Controller.php
App\Controller\Pro\Activity2Controller.php

So I am able to load the same route configuration on both Pub and Pro controllers with this configuration:
activity-1:
    resource: ../../src/Controller/*/Activity1Controller.php
    type: annotation
    name_prefix: activity-1_
    prefix: /activity-1

activity-2:
    resource: ../../src/Controller/*/Activity2Controller.php
    type: annotation
    name_prefix: activity-2_
    prefix: /activity-2
But now, in order to distinguish public and professional routes, I need to the same custom annotation on each Pro controllers:
/**
 * @Route("/professional", name="professional_")
 */

I am wondering if there is a better way to do this or if there is a way to not duplicate the annotation in all controllers?
