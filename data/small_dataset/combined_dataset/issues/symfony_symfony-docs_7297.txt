"Deep into" articles


I'd like to suggest a new type of articles I think the doc is missing: Some "Deep into ..." articles.
The actual doc is aimed to explain How to use the framework but I think it is missing some How it works articles. Those articles would target more experimented users, helping understanding how Symfony and it's components works. This would help customizing Symfony and components and potentially increasing the number of pull requests because there will be more developpers that understand the internals.
Let's take the Security for example. We have a main article explaining how to configure your security, how it basically work. But I would suggest an article "Deep into Security" that explain the workflow:

Firewall
Authenticator
Guard
User provider
Authorization
Voter
etc.

Right now, we have an article explaining How to create custom Voter, but it is hard to get when the voter get in action. The aim is to explain when each component come on stage, what does it do, how does it do it, ...
Hope it's clear enough.
