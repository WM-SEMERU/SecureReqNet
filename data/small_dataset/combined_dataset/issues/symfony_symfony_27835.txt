[Security] Using of TargetPathTrait in a Controller


Description
There is no easy way to use TargetPathTrait in a Controller, because of missing $providerKey that is current firewall name. There is no easy way to get FirewallMap or FirewallConfig to get the current firewall name.
Example
At least we can make FirewallMap service public to pass over Controller actions.
public function someAction(Request $request, FirewallMap $firewallMap)
{
    ...
    $currentFirewallName = $firewallMap->getFirewallConfig(request)->getName();
    ...
}

The case it would be useful:
A form has 2 routes with same path but different methods (GET to show, POST to submit). Showing form is public, but submitting is authorized. So I have to check in the beginning of POST action if user is granted some role (e.g. ROLE_USER). If not call saveTargetPath() and redirect to entry_point.
The access_control directive is useless there.
