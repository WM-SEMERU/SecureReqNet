[cookbook] Error in "custom Authentication Provider" listener code (and proposed fix)


Hi,
I've just followed this cookbook entry.
However I'm encountering an issue when pretty much exactly following it: an AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException is raised.
In my understanding the issue is that we should be doing something, returning prematurely in the listener is relevant only if another firewall is enabled, otherwise we end up having a 500 error.
This is not the case of the tutorial (the firewall is set for a very precise URL pattern): I guess we should be returning a 403 error, isn't it? And eventually adding a note to explain it.
I'm ok about submitting a PR if we agree upon the fix.
