Replaces #27817
By taking over session usage tracking and replacing it with token usage tracking, we can prevent responses that don't actually use the token from turning responses private without changing anything to the lifecycle of security listeners. This makes the behavior much more seamless, allowing to still log the user with the monolog processor, and display it in the profiler toolbar.
