[WIP DO NOT MERGE] server: disk offerings for specified domain(s) and zone(s)


Description
Problem: Storage offerings cannot be linked to specified multiple domain(s) and zone(s).
Root cause: Storage or disk offerings are independent of zones and they can be linked only to a single domain/sub-domain
Solution: Storage or disk offerings will be allowed to link with specified domain(s) and zone(s). Disk offering linked with multiple domains and zones can be created both with UI and API. Refactored createDiskOffering  API to allow passing list of domain and zone IDs with domainids and zoneids parameter respectively. UI has been refactored to allow selecting multiple domains and zones while creating disk offering using multi-select elements. When list of passed domains contain both parent and child domain offering will be created for parent domain. Disk offering details will now show list of linked domains and zones as a comma-separated list of names. Linked domains and zones will be stored in the cloud.disk_offering_details table in database as comma-separated list of IDs with key domainids and zoneids respectively.
