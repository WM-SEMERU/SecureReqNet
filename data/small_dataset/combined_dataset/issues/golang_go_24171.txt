proposal: crypto/cipher: allow short tags in NewGCMWithNonceAndTagSize


With the new API for customizing GCM tag size, it's finally possible to reduce the GCM tag overhead for some applications.  However, the new API comes with a hard limit on the minimal tag size, 12 bytes, which is just a 4 bytes saving compare to the default value.
For our use case, we use AES128-GCM to perform EtA on an IP packet flow. The data to encrypt has a bounded max size, and we call the authenticated decryption function for a limited times.  As we meets the circumstances described in Appendix C of the NIST 800-38D, using an 8-byte tag would be an overkill (<1400B payload and <2^31 invocations).
For the above reason, I'm proposing to relax the limit on the minimal tag size, and add a longer doc string for this function.  It's understandable that a crypto library should be safe to use with it's default parameters without further mangling, but for an API designed to customize the behavior should provide more flexibility.
