Please fix the referencing issues flagged by VS


Describe the bug
This appears to be a problem throughout the .Net Core ecosystem.
every part of .Net Core explicitly depends on older versions of assemblies instead of just having a minimum version resulting in me getting a lot of build warnings for simply being up to date with my project references.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Using version 2.* of ASP.NET Core
Create a new project, and add references to AspNet Core, the Azure Fluent API, and Newtonsoft.Json (as an example, these are pretty common references that people will have)
Complile the project
Witness the warning spam all over VS Error List window.

Expected behavior
No warnings, this sort of thing should just be acceptable by default
Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
Additional context
Some examples I currently have to deal with ...
Microsoft.AspNetCore.App v2.1.1. requires Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.Design >=2.1.1 && <2.2.0
Micorsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions requires NewtonSoft.Json v9.0.1
Found conflicts between versions Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives
Found Conflicts between versions of System.Net.Http.Formatting
