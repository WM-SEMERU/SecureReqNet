New Relic Ruby Agent Release Notes
v6.2.0


Bugfix for superfluous Empty JSON response error messages
Version 6.1.0 of the agent frequently logged error messages about an empty
JSON response, when no error had occurred.  These logs no longer appear.


Bugfix for Unable to calculate elapsed transaction time warning messages
Ruby Agent versions 5.4 through 6.1, when running in jruby without
ObjectSpace enabled, would occasionally log a warning indicating that the
agent was unable to calculate the elapsed transaction time.  When this log
statement appeared, the affected transactions would not be included in the
data displayed on the capacity analysis page.  These transactions are now
correctly recorded.


v6.1.0


Performance monitoring on Kubernetes
This release adds Transaction event attributes that provide
context between your Kubernetes cluster and services. For details
on the benefits, see this blog
post.


Bugfix for Bunny instrumentation when popping empty queues
When a customer calls Bunny::Queue#pop on an empty queue, Bunny
returns a nil value.  Previous Ruby Agent versions raised a
NoMethodError when trying to process this result.  Now, the
agent correctly skips processing for nil values.  Thanks to
Matt Campbell for the contribution.


v6.0.0


Tracer API for flexible custom instrumentation
With agent version 6.0, we are introducing the Tracer class, an
officially supported public API for more flexible custom
instrumentation.  By calling its in_transaction method, you can
instrument an arbitrary section of Ruby code without needing to
juggle any explicit state.  Behind the scenes, the agent will
make sure that the measured code results in an APM segment inside
a transaction.
The same API contains additional methods for creating
transactions and segments, and for interacting with the current
transaction.  For more details, see the [custom instrumentation
