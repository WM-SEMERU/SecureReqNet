[CLI 4.2.6][Symfony 3.4] The installer created the project with incomplete code


Today I created a new symfony project using version 3.4, And I got an incomplete code without any warnings. it contains only 2 dirs: config and vendor.
symfony new --full --version=3.4 ./3.4

But when I executed the same install command for the second time, everything was (looks like) fine.


Edit: no any other operations between 2 commands execution.
