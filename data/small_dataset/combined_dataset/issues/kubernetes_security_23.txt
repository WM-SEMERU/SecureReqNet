Change distributor applications from email to issues


Reasons for doing so:

Eliminate non-vulnerability reports from security@kubernetes.io
Provide public record of justifications for distributors list membership
Easier to track process

Downsides:

Requires the person filling in the application to have a github account
Makes the application public record (+/-)

In some ways, having someone apply with a PR to edit the documented list would be even cleaner, but you can't have multiple PR templates.
