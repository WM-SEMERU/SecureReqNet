Expression engine has_role() function can't process implicit roles


I have the following access control rules:
    access_control:
        - { path: ^/login$, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/user/register, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/user/resetting, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/admin, allow_if: "has_role('ROLE_ADMIN') and has_role('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY')" }
        - { path: ^/, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED }
4th access control rule has_role('ROLE_ADMIN') and has_role('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY') doesn't work as expected.
If I replace has_role('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY') with is_fully_authenticated() and revise access control rules as follows:
    access_control:
        - { path: ^/login$, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/user/register, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/user/resetting, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/admin, allow_if: "has_role('ROLE_ADMIN') and is_fully_authenticated()" }
        - { path: ^/, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED }
It works as expected. Further debugging yield me that the implicit IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY role cannot be processed by expression engine's has_role()method properly.
If IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED and IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY are roles (they can be used as a role setting in access control rules like in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th rules above), we should be able to use them in has_role() function as well otherwise it is so much confusing.
