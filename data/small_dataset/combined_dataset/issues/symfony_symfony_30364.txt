Apart from triggering the #30362 bug, the eval() block from #30124 also broke my workflow: static code analyzers don't like this, and the trait even crashes PHPStan.
It may also bring up other compatibility issues to other people (ie: I know companies that completely disable eval() on their servers).
As it was only required to keep the trait compatible with PHP 5.x, it is unnecessary on 4.x that requires PHP 7.1+, and this PR removes it on the 4.2 branch.
