'This is from the Recurity whitebox testing. I've verified that this works. You can even use:

```
ssh://-oProxyCommand=[snip]/a
```

To execute arbitrary shell commands using backticks.

Via the `Import Repository` functionality it is possible to execute commands on
the GitLab server under the `git` user.

Reproduction steps:

1. Click `New Project`, fill out a project name.
2. Click `git Repo by URL`.
3. Paste a URL like `ssh://-oProxyCommand=[snip]/a`.
4. Click `Create project`

Now the `ruby -esleep 1000` can be observed running on the GitLab server under
the `git` user.

As a short term mitigation
`gitlab-ee/app/validators/addressable_url_validator.rb` should exclude the `ssh`
entry in `DEFAULT_OPTIONS = { protocols: %w(http https ssh git) }.freeze`.

However the main problem lies in `git clone`, we've investigated this issue a
bit further, and figured that it's possible to create git repositories which
will execute arbitrary commands upon recursive checkout. If you like to we can report this issue to the git maintainers.
