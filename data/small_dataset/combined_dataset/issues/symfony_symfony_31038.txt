[Form] reversal of an error message when a CSRF token is invalid


If form is sent with an invalid CSRF token, this error message will be displayed: The CSRF token is invalid. Please try to resubmit the form.
This message is in fact instruction on how to bypass CSRF protection. This wording makes protection to be more like an attacker collaborator ;-)
Please change message to something like Your session has expired. Please return to the home page and try again..
