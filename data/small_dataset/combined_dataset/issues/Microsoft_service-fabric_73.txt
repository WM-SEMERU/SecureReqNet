AAD dialog window doesn't pop up automatically when connecting to an AAD-secured cluster using FabricClient


The following code in a C# Console Application should pop up a dialog box asking for AAD credentials when connecting to an AAD-secured cluster:
            string serverCertThumb = "A8136758F4AB8962AF2BF3F27921BE1DF67F4326";
            string connection = "clustername.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000";

            var claimsCredentials = new ClaimsCredentials();
            claimsCredentials.ServerThumbprints.Add(serverCertThumb);

            var fc = new FabricClient(claimsCredentials, connection);

            var ret = fc.ClusterManager.GetClusterManifestAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult(); ;
                Console.WriteLine(ret.ToString());
However, a sign-in dialog never comes up, instead authentication immediately fails with:
Unhandled Exception: System.Fabric.FabricException: The specified credentials are invalid. ---> System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: Exception from HRESULT: 0x80071BF7

I can get the dialog to work by manually adding references to the following assemblies:
Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.dll
Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.WindowsForms.dll
Both of these assemblies are included in the Service Fabric installation directory, but they are not automatically loaded, which breaks the AAD sign-in experience with FabricClient.
Cluster version: 6.1.472
Microsoft.ServiceFabric package version: 6.1.472
Local runtime version installed: 6.1.472
Local OS: Windows 10
