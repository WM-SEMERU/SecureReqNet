docker-machine not working behind certificate tampering firewall (severe cert hurt)


Running an image behind a corporate firewall that hacks the TLS certificate causes "docker run" to fail when pulling the image.
docker run -ti ubuntu /bin/bash
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally

All attempts to add the corporate certificate to the local machine have failed since docker 1.5.  (Currently using docker-machine 0.3.0 and docker 1.7.1 with VMware Fusion.)
It would be great to have an official procedure or even support for easily adding the corp certs.
