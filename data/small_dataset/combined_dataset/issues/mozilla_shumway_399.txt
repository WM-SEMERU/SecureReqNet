Possible Future Privacy Enhancement: Filter fonts/ disguise Shumway as original flash


I did a quick test of my browser uniqueness on https://panopticlick.eff.org
Quite a big chunk of identifying bits were discovered via flash .
"System Fonts   19.21 bits
1 in 604390 visitors has that font list" (via Flash)
It might be worth filtering down that list to make it more generic and less unique for each user.
Same is true for the plugin list that can also be remotely discovered.
I don't think we should list Shumway as Shumway, but as "Adobe Flash < official last secure version>"
Diffrences here, will either break a few flash sites that exspect a "proper" Adobe string and fail to accept diffrences, and/or will make a browser more  unique as you can already see in the font example.
