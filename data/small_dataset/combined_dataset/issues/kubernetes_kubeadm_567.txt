Code cleanup for Token Create, pubkey hash and print join command


Token create is implemented in three different points:

kubeadm init
kubeadm token *
kubeadm phase bootstrap-token create

There is room form cleaning up the code moving common code in a package; the same applies to the generation of pubkey hash and to the generation of the join command to be used for joining nodes.
