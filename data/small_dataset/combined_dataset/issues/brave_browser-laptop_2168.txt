Fixed UI for passive (display) mixed content

Describe the issue you encountered: I tried to add a class to urlbarIcon on mixed content pages, and noticed that isMixedContent did not seem to be ready yet though it was mentioned here: https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/blob/master/js/components/siteInfo.js#L18
Because of it the siteInfo panel on https://mixed-script.badssl.com/ says that the site is secure where it should not, though the script is blocked.
