ngStyle not removing values

 regression from 1.6.x to 1.7.8

 issue caused by a new browser version

Current behavior:
In AngularJS 1.6 (and even in 1.7.0) the ngStyle directive was able to add/remove single properties when the expression for the single property was evaluated as false.
For example:
ng-style="{'float': isRight && 'right' }" 
was dynamically adding/removing the 'float: right' style when the isRight scope expression changed.
In Angular 1.7.8 this only happens when isRight switches from false to true. Switching back to false will leave the 'float: right' style set.
As a workaround, this expression instead works in both 1.6.x and 1.7.8:
ng-style="isRight && {'float': 'right' }"
Expected / new behavior:
Expressions like
ng-style="{'float': isRight && 'right' }"
should be still supported for backward compatibility. Or at least the change (if intentional) should be documented in the changelog documentation.
