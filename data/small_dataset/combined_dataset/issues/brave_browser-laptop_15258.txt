Atlassian Cloud Not Loading


Description
Curious what is happening here. I have shields down and Atlassian is not loading still. This is happening in Brave and Brave Beta. I want to get away from Chrome and this is the last thing that makes me go back to it.
Please help me abandon Chrome once and for all!
