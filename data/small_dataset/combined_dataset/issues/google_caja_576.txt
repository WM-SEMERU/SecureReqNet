addEventListener does not whitelist event type.


Original issue 576 created by tyler.close on 2008-06-13T00:12:08.000Z:
addEventListener takes a string name for the event to register for and only
ensures that the argument is a string. Any string value is accepted. In
contrast, setAttribute requires that the attribute name be a known value.
Consequently, some kinds of event handlers can be registered through
addEventListener, but not setAttribute.
