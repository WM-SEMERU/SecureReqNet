[Csrf] Why CsrfToken class?


The TokenManager works works with CsrfToken instances. I wonder why because

A token instance only has id and value, so no more information than is already available.
The removeToken somewhat inconsistently does not work with instances (but returning a removed instance would be strange as well)
It returns a new instance each time, only the value is the same.

So why not remove the class and simply return the string? cc @bschussek
