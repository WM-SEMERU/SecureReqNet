When a 3rd party dispatches a message, the user may need to apply some custom stamps to that message - especially stamps that configure how that message is handled by the transport. We already have one simple example of this from #30557 - the DelayStamp. This would allow the user to very easily (without needing to create a middleware and register it) add this stamp to a 3rd party message, or future stamps (e.g. stamps for transport/queue priority).
