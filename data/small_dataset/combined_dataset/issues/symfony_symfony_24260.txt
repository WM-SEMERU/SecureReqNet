The switch_user listener triggers a redirection in case of success and thus does not play well with stateless authentication which is common nowadays (as opposed to other listeners like the exception one).
This adds a new stateless option to the switch_user listener, if set to true then no redirection is triggered during user switching.
This will avoid the need for lafourchette/SwitchUserStatelessBundle which just duplicated the symfony SwitchUserListener (with config factory) at a given state to avoid the 2 LOC which are causing the redirection.
The bundle is not actively maintained and the listener it provides is out of date due to the missing upstream additions and bug fixes (see lafourchette/SwitchUserStatelessBundle#10).
