Didn't think, I will write this ticket, but here it goes. GitLab generates too many e-mails based on 1 event. IMHO, 1 event = 1 email. Not three, or four.

Examples:

User comments merge request. Following e-mails are generated:
1. notification about comment merge request.
2. notification about comment in commit.
3. notification about mention of commit in merge request.
4. (not always, but seen) notification of mention of merge request in commit. 

4 emails for one event. Too much!

Closing merge request generates two identical notifications. 

Closing by commit generate two messages: Issue closed by commit and issue was closed. 


And while we here: user A assigned merge request to user C. User B came and merged issue. Two identical notifications does not show that.
