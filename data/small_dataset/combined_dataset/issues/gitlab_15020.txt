We should have a way to require 2FA in certain group rather than the full instance only.

On the current setup, GitLab 8.7.0rc1, 2FA settings can only be reviewed under `admin/settings`. 

We can setup such that the owner of a group can require members to activate 2FA in order to access the group's content i.e. repos, issues, MRs etc. 

Otherwise, they cannot be part of that specific group but can do their normal activities outside the group i.e. work on their repos and other groups that don't have this requirement.

What do you think @JobV ?
