#10035



Configuring guard along with http_digest breaks, because the default entry point for the firewall is automatically the guard authenticator, which is not a BasicAuthenticationEntryPoint / DigestAuthenticationEntryPoint.
We do create the entry point if there is no default entry point configured, so we should keep creating it if the default one is not an instance of BasicAuthenticationEntryPoint / DigestAuthenticationEntryPoint.
Related to lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle#384.
