Block link-local and localhost service/endpoint addresses in apiserver proxy


Reported by @stephenR
It's possible to turn the master into a proxy to localhost or the GCE metadata server by adding a new endpoint that points to the service.
To reproduce, add a new endpoint by posting to http://apiserver/api/v1beta3/endpoints with a description like:
{ "metadata": { "name": "myendpoint", [...] },
  "subsets": [
    {
      "addresses": [
        { "IP": "169.254.169.254", [...] }
      ],
      "ports": [
        { "port": 80, "protocol": "TCP" }
] } ] }

If you then go to http://apiserver/api/v1beta3/proxy/namespaces/default/services/myendpoint/ you can interact with the master's metadata server.
We can't validate that Endpoints are within the cluster CIDR because we deliberately allow importing of external addresses -- that was the original purpose of allowing users to post Endpoints.
I wouldn't disallow link-local and localhost addresses in Endpoints, either, since that might be useful in the future. I'd prefer to just disallow proxying to such addresses.
Obviously we'd need to resolve DNS names before checking.
