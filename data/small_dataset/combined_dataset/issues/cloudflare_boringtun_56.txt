Do not panic when adding peers with duplicate public keys


As an API user, I would appreciate an error rather than killing the whole application:
    fn update_peer(
        &mut self,
        pub_key: X25519PublicKey,
        remove: bool,
        _replace_ips: bool,
        endpoint: Option<SocketAddr>,
        allowed_ips: Vec<AllowedIP>,
        keepalive: Option<u16>,
        preshared_key: Option<[u8; 32]>,
    ) {
// ...
        // Update an existing peer
        if self.peers.get(&pub_key).is_some() {
            // We already have a peer, we need to merge the existing config into the newly created one
            panic!("Modifying existing peers is not yet supported. Remove and add again instead.");
        }
