Feature Request: npm install Should Only Install Exact Versions Unless Explicitly Overridden


What's the feature?
IMO npm install should only install exact packages unless explicitly told not to via a flag e.g. --allow-package-upgrades.
What problem is the feature intended to solve?

Would make CI builds repeatable by default
Would make it impossible to accidentally, silently upgrade to a compromised package e.g. #21202
