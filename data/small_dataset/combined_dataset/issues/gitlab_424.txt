Hi, 

I tried to upgrade to 7.0-stable version, and have a new problem :

When I tried to create a new repository, got this error :

```
Issues enabled is not included in the list
```

I revert to 6.9 and the same error message happened with this version.
Any idea / help ?

Don't hesitate to ask me some details about my installation !

Thank's in advance,
