Implement WheelEvent interface


Created a new dom interface: "WheelEvent" and added WPT tests to confirm the interface works. To do this I had to do the following:

Create a new WheelEvent dom interface. It can be found in script/dom/wheelevent.rs and dom/webidls/WheelEvent.webidl
Add a new WheelEvent option to the compositor's CompositorEvent enum
Add a new Wheel option to the compositor's WindowEvent enum
Add a new WheelDelta type to the script_traits module
Modify the scroll_event logic. Now we send a WheelEvent before scrolling. Repeat: we send the WheelEvent notification BEFORE we send the scroll delta.
Add two manual wpt tests to the uievents/order-of-events test collection
