Hi!
I've upgrader my GitLab to 6.8 version. But since the upgrade, the default no_avatar image does not display.
After somes research, the image called is /assets/no_avatar.png
But in my assets folder, the image is no_avatar-1af60455b82013dc3c9d9079cb021d47.png

So i've an 404 error from nginx.

Thanks!
