Validate allowed_ips for overlapping addresses


If a two peers are added with 0.0.0.0/0, then that should probably be rejected with an error. Based on $insert in allowed_ips.rs and the code below, it looks like the current behavior is to silently overwrite existing peers. Not sure if that is desirable.
    fn update_peer(
        // ...
        allowed_ips: Vec<AllowedIP>,
        // ...
    ) {
        // ...
        for AllowedIP { addr, cidr } in allowed_ips {
            self.peers_by_ip.insert(addr, cidr as _, Arc::clone(&peer));
        }
It would be nice to have tests as well. One thing I am not entirely sure about is how to handle overlapping ranges, e.g. 10.1.2.0/24 and 10.1.2.100/32.
