Consider adding SAML support for the security component


Context
SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based, open-standard data format for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider.
Problem
SAML is increasingly popular among companies, academic institutions and other high-profile entities which are the target of Symfony. For example, providing SAML support is one of the big new features recently announced by GitHub (details)
Symfony Security doesn't provide support for SAML, but other comparable projects do: Django through djangosaml2 and Spring through Spring Security SAML.
Solution
Not so long ago we added support for LDAP, so adding new big security features is something that Symfony is open to do.
If you think this doesn't belong to Symfony Core, then I'd say it doesn't belong either to a third-party project, because it's too important and too critical to do it right. So, maybe Symfony could create some pseudo-official projects (second-party projects?) to provide features that don't belong to core but are considered important.
