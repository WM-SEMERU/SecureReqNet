Use the `/q` flag with `cmd.exe` in `child_process.spawn()`


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
child_process.spawn() with shell: true on Windows calls cmd.exe /d /s /c.
This makes childProcess.stdout include the prompt and command with Batch files.
Describe the solution you'd like
Add the /q flag.
Alternatives
Adding @echo off to Batch files.
