Description
I'm unable to build angular library.
Building my angular library with command ng build angular-library shows error:
BUILD ERROR
Could not resolve entry (C:\Users..\angular-library\dist\esm2015\angular-library.js)
Error: Could not resolve entry (C:\Users..\angular-library\dist\esm2015\angular-library.js)
at error (C:\Users..\node_modules\rollup\dist\rollup.js:3598:30)
at C:\Users..\node_modules\rollup\dist\rollup.js:18005:17
I've been struggling for hours, with no avail. I removed all usages of barrels in my library and made sure imports are correct. Error is not clear and doesn't tell me where to search for the issue.
üî¨ Minimal Reproduction
