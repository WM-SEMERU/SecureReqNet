HTTP[S]-hosted Git credential management


I'm working with a couple of custom modules that are installed via git+https urls that are password protected and running into issues.  It looks like there is an interaction between git and npm that leads to git trying to ask for credentials multiple times, at the same time:
csalch@Chriss-MacBook-Air ~/code/bestfit/bf-banking/api $ npm install
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/loopback
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/express
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/mqtt
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/loopback-connector-mongodb
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/node-uuid
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/async
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/lodash
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/jquery-file-upload-middleware
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/loopback-push-notification
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/loopback-connector-mongodb
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/loopback
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/async
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/lodash
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/express
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/mqtt
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/node-uuid
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/jquery-file-upload-middleware
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/loopback-push-notification
Password for 'https://redacted@bitbucket.org': Password for 'https://redacted@bitbucket.org':

ssh urls seem to work fine, but that won't work in our environment.  I've tried several different approaches but have found nothing that will let me have more than one git dependency.
