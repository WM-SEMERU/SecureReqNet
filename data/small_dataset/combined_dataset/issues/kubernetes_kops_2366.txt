Upgrade from Kubernetes 1.5.6 to 1.6.x breaks weave


Seems like weave daemonset was not upgraded when I upgraded the cluster.
As a workaround I manually deleted the daemon set and re-created it following weave's docs:
kubectl delete daemonset weave-net -n kube-system
kubectl apply -f https://git.io/weave-kube-1.6

Tested with kops 1.6.0-alpha.2
