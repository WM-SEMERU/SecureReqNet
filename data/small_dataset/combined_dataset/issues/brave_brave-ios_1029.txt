Implement 'Bookmark all tabs' feature


Description:
For parity with desktop, an option to bookmark all open tabs. This option would allow you to specify a folder in which each opened tab will be bookmarked.
Users would like the ability to sync opened tabs between devices. That would require a bit more work; bookmarking all opened tabs (and opening tabs for all bookmarks in a folder) would allow us to offer a minimal-friction work-around until a more complete solution is available.
