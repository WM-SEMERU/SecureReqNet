Show stack trace of Doctrine query


Description
When a page executes too many queries it would be extremely useful to know where these queries are executed. Since these queries are generated by Doctrine it is very non-obvious where they are coming from.
Example

I would add another toggle "Show stack trace" that shows you exactly where the query was executed in your code.
