Avoid static mutables in Cajoler


Original issue 505 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-11T18:44:32.000Z:
The Cajoler code (Java code) seems to contain some static mutables. This
should be avoided.  The Cajoler might be called by a multithreaded
webserver (i.e., one thread might call the Cajoler while another thread is
in the middle of also calling the Cajoler).  Static mutable state in the
Cajoler is a hazard, given this.  Therefore, all static mutable variables
should be eliminated.
