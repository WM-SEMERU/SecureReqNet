[Security:ContextListenerg] Bug - refreshUser method makes method calls on unserialized user object


Class: Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\ContextListener
Method: refreshUser
Line: 146
Symfony v2.3.6
PROBLEM TRACE: ==========

ContextListener grabs the unserialized object to check whether it implements UserInterface, line 148:

$user = $token->getUser();

User received from the UserProvider is injected into $token but the $user variable in the method is still the unserialized user object, line 159:

$token->setUser($provider->refreshUser($user));

Debug calls the getUsername() method on the unserialized user object but it should make the call on the user object received from UserProvider, lines 162, 170:

$this->logger->debug(sprintf('Username "%s" was reloaded from user provider.', $user->getUsername()));
SOLUTION: ==========
...$user->getUsername() ..
// $user to be the User object recevied from the UserProvider as this one has the properties set, where the unserialized object usually only has the "id" set.
