Updated the Finder component docs


This PR modernizes the contents of Finder as follows:

New content structure: "Sorting" has been moved into its own section, and a new section has been created for "Transforming Results into Arrays" (which previously was a bunch of caution messages):

Installation
Usage
Searching for Files and Directories
Sorting Results
Transforming Results into Arrays
Reading Contents of Returned Files



New "criteria" section for "VCS Files" (mostly needed for "master" version, where new features have been added related to that).


Minor tweaks and improvements, such as updating the S3 example to use the official AWS SDK.
