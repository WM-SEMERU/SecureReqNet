crypto: Add crypto/dh to the stdlib


by deleted.evan.phoenix@hungrymachine.com:
Please consider adding crypto/dh, found here: https://github.com/evanphx/go-crypto-dh to
the stdlib. RSA and EC are already present and using diffie hellman for custom crypto
protocols is very useful.

Thanks for your consideration!
