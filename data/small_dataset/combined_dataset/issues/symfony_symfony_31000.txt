The documentation (https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration/environment_variables.html#config-env-vars) give the following example:
parameters:
    env(HOST): '10.0.0.1'
    env(SENTRY_DSN): 'http://%env(HOST)%/project'
sentry:
    dsn: '%env(resolve:SENTRY_DSN)%'
This example works because the parameter env(HOST) is literally defined in the parameters sections. Reading the documentation we could think that env(HOST) is resolved by trying to read the HOST env variable then fallback to the default parameter, but it's not the case.
If I write the following same application using .env file I would have the error The parameter "env(HOST)" must be defined.
# .env
HOST="10.0.0.1"
SENTRY_DSN="http://%env(HOST)%/project"
This PR fix it. my use case is
# .env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:root@localhost/db_name"

# .env.prod
DATABASE_URL="mysql://my_user:%env(secret:DATABASE_PASSWORD)%@service.com/db_name"
note: to access the getEnv() which calls the list of env processors, I've to change the visibility of the method. Tell me we have another way to do it.
