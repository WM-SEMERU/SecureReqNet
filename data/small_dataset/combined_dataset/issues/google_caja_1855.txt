Separate non-DOM tamed APIs from DOM


Original issue 1857 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-09-09T23:30:01.000Z:
Currently, the environment of a guest is either:

standard JS globals (and cajaVM, WeakMap, etc.), or
that plus document, window, setTimeout & friends, and XMLHttpRequest.

There should be a way to provide facilities such as setTimeout and XMLHttpRequest without the entire DOM taming.
This is natural for 'headless' sandboxes analogous to web workers, and would avoid the code size and initialization cost of Domado for applications which do not need it (well, provided that we make the guest frame code non-monolithic). It might also be a useful refactoring of domado.js.
