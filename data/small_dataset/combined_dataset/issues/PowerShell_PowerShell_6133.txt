Port Windows PowerShell AppLocker and DeviceGuard UMCI application white listing support


PR Summary
These changes port Windows PowerShell support for Applocker and DeviceGuard User Mode Code Integrity (UMCI) to PSCore6.  Windows PowerShell uses public APIs to determine if a system is in locked down mode via AppLocker or DeviceGuard, and automatically runs in constrained language mode.  For more information about PowerShell constrained language, see: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2017/11/02/powershell-constrained-language-mode/
This support for application white listing has mostly existed in PSCore6, but the primary APIs were stubbed out in CorePSStub.cs because they relied on Windows only DeviceGuard (wldp.dll) and AppLocker (Safer APIs) public APIs.  These changes re-implement PowerShell lock down APIs on PSCore6 for Windows platforms only.  The AppLocker and DeviceGuard public APIs are currently only implemented in Windows OSes and are not supported on Linux or MacOS platforms.
Tests have also been ported to PSCore6 and run only for Windows platforms.
