View certificate on mixed content site


fix #8530
Auditors: @diracdeltas
Test Plan:

Go to https://mixed-script.badssl.com/
We should be able to view certificate
Click load unsafe scripts
We should still have option to view certificate


 Submitted a ticket for my issue if one did not already exist.
 Used Github auto-closing keywords in the commit message.
 Added/updated tests for this change (for new code or code which already has tests).
 Ran git rebase -i to squash commits (if needed).
