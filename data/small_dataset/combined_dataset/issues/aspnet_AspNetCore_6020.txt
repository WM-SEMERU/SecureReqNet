[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = AzureADDefaults.BearerAuthenticationScheme)] generates compiler error CS0182


According to the documentation it should be possible to explicitly specify or override the AuthenticationScheme for a controller with the Authorize attribute.
The following snippet is from the ValuesController.cs file in the base ASP.NET Core Web Application API template with "Work or School accounts" authentication.
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = AzureADDefaults.BearerAuthenticationScheme)]
[ApiController]
public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
{ ... } 
However, the above code generates compiler error CS0182: An attribute argument must be a constant expression, typeof expression or array creation expression of an attribute parameter type.
A potential fix could be to change the member properties of AzureADDefaults from static readonly to const as in the JwtBearerDefaults class
public const string BearerAuthenticationScheme = "AzureADBearer";
