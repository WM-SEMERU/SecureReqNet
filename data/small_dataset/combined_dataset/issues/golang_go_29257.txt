proposal: crypto/tls: allow access to file descriptor for tls.Conn


Currently it is not possible to access FD in tls.Conn
in tls.Conn the underlying net.Conn is not accessible except in ClientHelloInfo
Senario:
in net/http we can't access the FD for https connections but we can access it for http connections
in a WebSocket connection after Hijack, when the connection is http we can use netpoll but when its https we can't
the only workaround right now is using a https to http proxy but it's not efficient as exposing the net.Conn on tls.Conn
