Skip slowest ConstantinopleFix fixture tests and Benchmarks


What was wrong?
Fixes #1733 -- St Petersburg is regularly one of the slowest tests to run
Addresses #1607 -- benchmarking is slow
How was it fixed?
No reason to think that any slow Constantinople tests are fast in Petersburg, so I just duplicated them all over.
Run duration changed from 8:31 -> 1:43
Benchmark was just sloppily changed while waiting for someone to clean up #1629 . I don't think it's reasonable to shorten the "Simple value transfer" even though it's the biggest offender (2 minutes total). I think the right solution to that is to make it so that we can process more than 10 tx/s X)
Run duration changed from 5:45 -> 2:36
