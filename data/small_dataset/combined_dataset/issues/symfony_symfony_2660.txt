[ContextListener] The SecurityDataCollector class is getting roles that are not yet bound


I am having a problem where the -to-many relationships on my User class are not being properly bound when the collect method of SecurityDataCollector is being called. This means that when the roles are retrieved from $token, each role is populated with Null and not the string values associated to the specific user i've just logged in with.
This seems an issue when logging in using the traditional login form method (as documented here http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/security.html#using-a-traditional-login-form) and in security.xml  having an access control where the admin area is expecting a user to have a specific role. However no roles are bound to the user when the data array is populated in the collect method of SecurityDataCollector.
I hope this gives you enough issue to fix this issue.
