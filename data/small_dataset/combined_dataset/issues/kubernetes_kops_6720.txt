Question: Upgrading kubernetes version using yaml


Hello All,
I need to change the instance types of my nodes & master because they are lacking memory. Since I'm this big change I thought it would be a good opportunity to upgrade to 1.11.x (I'm on 1.10.x) and also upgrade OS.
I'm using a Kops YAML file. I wonder how to upgrade kubernetes using a YAML and what's is the best approach.
I would upgrade my kops using brew
So I was thinking about updating these lines in my YAML file:
kind: Cluster
....
kubernetesVersion: 1.10.3 would be changed to 1.11.9

kind: InstanceGroup
....
machineType: m3.medium would change to m5.large
image: kope.io/k8s-1.9-debian-jessie-amd64-hvm-ebs-2018-03-11  would be changed to kope.io/k8s-1.11-debian-stretch-amd64-hvm-ebs-2018-08-17
...
role: Master

kind: InstanceGroup
....
machineType: t2.medium would change to t2.large
image: kope.io/k8s-1.9-debian-jessie-amd64-hvm-ebs-2018-03-11  would be changed to kope.io/k8s-1.11-debian-stretch-amd64-hvm-ebs-2018-08-17
...
role: Nodes

kind: InstanceGroup
....
machineType: <will-not-change>
image: kope.io/k8s-1.9-debian-jessie-amd64-hvm-ebs-2018-03-11  would be changed to kope.io/k8s-1.11-debian-stretch-amd64-hvm-ebs-2018-08-17
...
role: Bastions

Then I was thinking about doing kops replace --force point to a file followed by a kops update cluster
And finally a rolling-upgrade.
Is that OKey? What's is the best approach upgrading when using a YAML instead kops edit approach? Do I need to change the OS? Is there anything else I need to change in the YAML?
