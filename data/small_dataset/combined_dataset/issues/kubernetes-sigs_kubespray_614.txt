Drop capabilities for etcd/kube services/k8s apps Kargo runs in containers


See http://rhelblog.redhat.com/2016/10/17/secure-your-containers-with-this-one-weird-trick/
The consequent of dropped caps is that etcd service units and k8s apps must launch unprivileged containers under their own users instead of the root. And permissions to certs/state dirs must be as well adjusted to become shared.
