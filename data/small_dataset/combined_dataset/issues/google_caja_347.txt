'in' needs to translate to canReadPub/canReadProp


Original issue 347 created by erights on 2008-06-01T02:33:29.000Z:
In r1541
<script type="text/javascript">
'_FROZEN_' in Object;
</script>
cajoles to
<script type="text/javascript">{
_.loadModule(function (, IMPORTS__) {
{
var Object = _.readImports(IMPORTS, 'Object');
caja.result('_FROZEN' in Object);
}
});
}</script>
which evaluates to true. The problem is that we aren't translating 'in'
(beyond expanding its operands). This allows Caja code to test which
property names are actually present on the object at the uncajoled level,
which should be hidden.
