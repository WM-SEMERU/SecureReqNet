e2e incompatible with Chrome Update functionality

Is this report about the crypto library or the extension?
the extension, conceptually.
What is the security bug?
If Chrome is configured to allow automatic updates, or if the user explicitly updates Chrome, Google can ship hostile binary code that will reveal the user's private key.
How would someone exploit it?
The government sends Google a National Security Letter or other such demand to send a hostile update to a user's computer, which will then send key material back to Google, who will then relay it back to the government.
