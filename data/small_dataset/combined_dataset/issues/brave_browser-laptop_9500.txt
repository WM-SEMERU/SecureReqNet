incorrect hostname shown in titlemode when host is very long


issue exists in 0.17.x but is fixed in 0.18.x by #9154

go to https://longextendedsubdomainnamewithoutdashesinordertotestwordwrapping.badssl.com/
mouse away from the urlbar to enter title mode
the origin is shown as 'longextendedsubdomainnamewithoutdashesinordertotestwordwrapping' instead of 'longextendedsubdomainnamewithoutdashesinordertotestwordwrapping.badssl.com'
