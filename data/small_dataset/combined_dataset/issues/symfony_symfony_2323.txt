[Security] HttpUtils does not support absolute URL's


The documentation for HttpUtils states that the $path parameter may be:

A path (an absolute path (/foo), an absolute URL (http://...), or a route name (foo))

Internally, the method only supports absolute paths (if the first character is a /) or a route comparison. Should the method be enhanced to support absolute URL's? If not, we should at least change the documentation.
For an absolute URL check, I suppose we could scan the string for a protocol ://, unless it makes more sense to just check for /^https?:\/\// match.
Either way, I'm willing to make the fix (adding support or doc change). Just want to collect some feedback before proceeding.
