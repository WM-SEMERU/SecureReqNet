Tighten validation of mirror pod annotations


Tightens validation for pods with a mirror pod annotation:

spec.nodeName must be set
makes the mirror pod annotation immutable
starts validating pod-specific annotations during pod status update

None of these changes affect usage of the mirror pod annotation by kubelets, which only set it on pod creation (verified this is true back to 1.5.x)
the second commit updates the pod validation tests to look for specific error messages (best reviewed ignoring whitespace changes)
This is the validation portion of https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/kubelet-authorizer.md and kubernetes/enhancements#279
Mirror pods must now indicate the nodeName they are bound to on creation. The mirror pod annotation is now treated as immutable and cannot be added to an existing pod, removed from a pod, or modified.
