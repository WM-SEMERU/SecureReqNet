Description
When attempting to make a CORS request from javascript, 307 redirect responses to the same domain are blocked. The error which appears is Access to fetch at 'https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/' from origin 'https://dashboard.nodesmith.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: Redirect is not allowed for a preflight request.
In this example we are receiving a redirect (307) response, the redirect domain is exactly the same as the original, so the redirect should be allowed.
Here's what the request looks like
General
Request URL: https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
Request Method: OPTIONS
Status Code: 307 Internal Redirect
Referrer Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
Response Headers
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://dashboard.nodesmith.io
Location: https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
Non-Authoritative-Reason: Delegate
Request Headers
Provisional headers are shown
Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type,x-amz-target,x-amz-user-agent
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Origin: https://dashboard.nodesmith.io
Referer: https://dashboard.nodesmith.io/
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.110 Safari/537.36
I don't see the same issues in Chrome or Firefox. Additionally, if I enable 3rd party cookies for the page, the request will go through (I'm not quite sure how the 3rd party cookies are related to all this).
Steps to Reproduce
Edit: These steps no longer reproduce the issue because we switched out authentication system to get around this bug. There are plenty of other examples of the bug in the issue though.

Go to https://dashboard.nodesmith.io/#/logIn
Enter foo@bar.com for username and ABC123!@# for a password
Hit Log In

EXPECTED: Requests hit the IDP servers and notify that the password is invalid
ACTUAL: CORS error on the 307 response
