enforce the interface relationship between ServicePort and BaseServiceInfo


Currently the BaseServiceInfo struct implements the ServicePort interface, but
only uses that interface sometimes. All the elements of BaseServiceInfo are exported
and sometimes the interface is used to access them and othertimes not
I extended the ServicePort interface so that all relevent values can be accessed through
it and unexported all the elements of BaseServiceInfo
