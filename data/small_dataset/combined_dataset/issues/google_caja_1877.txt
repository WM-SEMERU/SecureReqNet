Fails to load jquery-ui.css


Original issue 1879 created by FHS.CCClassic on 2014-01-05T02:57:55.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
Firefox v26 and others
Whatever version is used by google sites
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.simply create a google sites page that has the following:
<link rel='stylesheet' href='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.21/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css' />
and it will fail to load.
2.The jquery and jquery ui both load but the UI needs the .css
3. The examples on the caja playground do not work for this reason when copied into an HTML box  in Google sites.
What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output is a normal edit. Code tested works outside of google sites but the editor for the Google sites HTML box reports:
"failed to load external url jquery-ui.css" error message
Please provide any additional information below.
The assumption for reporting this "bug" is that google sites uses caja since you see caja when you look at the source for a page. All seems to work until you need the jquery-ui.css
