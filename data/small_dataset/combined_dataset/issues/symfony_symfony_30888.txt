As discussed with @joelwurtz, extract normalizer functionality tests into traits to ensure consistent behaviour of all normalizers.

 Rebase when #30977, #30950 and #30907 are merged to master blocker
 Clean up order of trait inclusion and methods in the tests
 Clean up fixture classes of the traits. I started having one class named the same as the trait, where possible

Stuff that we should do eventually, but can also do in separate pull requests, after this one has been merged:

 Extract all features that we can (the existing normalizer tests should more or less only have the legacy tests in them, all functionality should be in trait)
 Run test coverage and increase coverage so that we cover all important features and all relevant error cases.
