Details:
PoC:
https://gitlab.com/-/boards/813851/users.json
https://gitlab.com/-/boards/813851/milestones.json

This is possible because the board endpoint doesn't require authorisation to view the users.json and milestones.json

board with id 813851 belongs to the gruop 3711406, which is private.

## Steps to reproduce
Make a group, set it to be private, and create a board, jot down the board id, and now you can view the member of the private group with these url

https://gitlab.com/-/boards/{board_id}/users.json
https://gitlab.com/-/boards/{board_id}/milestones.json

easiest way to verify probably is to go https://gitlab.com/-/boards/1/milestones.json https://gitlab.com/-/boards/1/users.json

and keep increasing the ID of the board, and you will notice none of them require authorisation.

Just remember to login before you visit the url.
