## Problem

Throttling by banning the whole IP with 403s for an hour is confusing to debug, and is unnecessarily harsh on legitimate users who unintentionally trigger the ban. E.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support-forum/issues/3274

## Proposal

Switch to normal throttle behavior for Git and JWT requests, counting only failed auth requests (as we already do). Respond to all Git and JWT requests with 429 if the failed auth requests have exceeded the rate limit.

This way, we mitigate "smart" brute force attempts as effectively as we do now, and legitimate users don't get blocked from GitLab.com and switch to a competitor.

## What benefit do we get from the current fail2ban behavior?

When the offender (intentional or not) actually goes over the limit, the site load and number of attempts are drastically reduced with a ban rather than a regular throttle.

Whereas an attacker with knowledge of the limit would be mitigated equally effectively with a ban as with a regular throttle.
