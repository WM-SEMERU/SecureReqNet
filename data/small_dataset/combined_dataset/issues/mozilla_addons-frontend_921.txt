Strip style attributes from HTML tags in add-on description


The old addons-server code stripped all HTML tag attributes (with some exceptions). This would strip out any style attributes. Even though we're using a dom-purify on addons-frontend, it doesn't strip style attributes. I don't know how serious it is because I can't think of a real XSS. However, there may be a possibility by crafting an add-on that has something like this in the description:
<b style="background-image: url(javascript:alert(document.cookie))">placeholder</b>
