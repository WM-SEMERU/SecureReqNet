not clear how to run AMD loader test


Original issue 1838 created by dckc@madmode.com on 2013-08-10T17:51:14.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
Using Chrome 28.0.1500.71 on Linux
What steps will reproduce the problem?

check out caja Rev: 5049
cd google-caja-read-only/src/com/google/caja/ses
xdg-open explicit.html

What is the expected output?
AMD loader test...succeeded
What do you see instead?
AMD loader test...failed: Error: NetworkError: DOM Exception 19
Please provide any additional information below.
Opening it as file:// clearly won't work. I could perhaps have figured that out, but it felt like guesswork.
I was just hoping to see something either in or near explicit.html that says "serve this up via http and load it in a browser".
Using tools/httpdhere.py from the ses directory doesn't work either; it has to be started from the project root.
Also, kpreid tells me I should be looking at the chrome dev console for diagnostics. While fairly obvious, that would be a reassuring clue to find documented as well.
