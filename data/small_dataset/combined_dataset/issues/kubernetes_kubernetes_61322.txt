kubeadm: etcd certs missing in self-hosted deploy


Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?:
/kind bug
What happened:
In #60385, certs for etcd get created but are not projected into the apiserver pod when StoreCertsInSecrets is set to true.
What you expected to happen:
The certs should be created as secrets when StoreCertsInSecrets is set to true, and then they should be projected in the apiserver.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
kubeadm init --feature-gates=SelfHosting=true,StoreCertsInSecrets=true
