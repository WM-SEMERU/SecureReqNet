[FramworkBundle][Messenger] Not possible to overwrite transport options


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.x
Description
It is not possible to overwrite transport options for different environments. As the option config node is an aray node, the config values are deep merged resulting in array that can not be resolved by the OptionResolver.
How to reproduce
overwrite transport options for a specific environment e.g. test:
# in framework.yaml
framework
    messenger:
        transports:
            default:
                options:
                    receiveTimeout: 1000
# in test/framework.yaml
framework
    messenger:
        transports:
            default:
                options:
                    receiveTimeout: 200
Possible Solution
add performNoDeepMerging() to the array node solves the problem for me, but i don't know if that has any downsides or if the root cause of the problem is something else.
Maybe there are more config nodes this problem applies to.
Additional context
Log looks like this:
Symfony\Component\OptionsResolver\Exception\UndefinedOptionsException : The option "0" does not exist. Defined options are: "delayStrategy", "deliveryDelay", "priority", "queue", "receiveTimeout", "timeToLive", "topic".
 /app/vendor/symfony/options-resolver/OptionsResolver.php:747

The passed Options array looks like:
[
    'receiveTimeout' => 1000,
    0 => 200
]
