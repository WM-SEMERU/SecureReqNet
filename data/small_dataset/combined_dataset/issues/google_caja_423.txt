Caja provides no isolation


Original issue 423 created by erights on 2008-06-09T02:50:39.000Z:
getLogFunc() and especially setLogFunc() should have been available only on
___, not caja. Because they are available as caja.getLogFunc() and
caja.setLogFunc(), Caja currently provides no isolation. In the top pane of
the testbed applet, cajole
<script type="text/javascript">
caja.setLogFunc(function(){return 3469;});
</script>
Then, in the bottom pane, cajole
<script type="text/javascript">
caja.getLogFunc()();
</script>
It prints 3469, demonstrating a trivial and total breach of isolation.
