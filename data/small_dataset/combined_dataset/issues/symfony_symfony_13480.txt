[Security] Authentication providers are not typehinted


It seems that authentication providers are added through an array in the AuthenticationProviderManager, but are not checked on implementation of the AuthenticationProviderInterface.
This means that any call to supports and authenticate might fail. As providers can only be added through the constructor, it's trivial to add a check on the instance and thrown InvalidArgumentException if not correct.
