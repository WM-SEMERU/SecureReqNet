Taking the following firewall:
main:
    entry_point: default_entrypoint_service
    some_listener: ~
    another_listener: ~
    guard:
        authenticators:
            - some_authenticator
        entry_point: some_authenticator
leads to the following error:

The guard authentication provider cannot use the "some_authenticator" entry_point because another entry point is already configured by another provider! Either remove the other provider or move the entry_point configuration as a root key under your firewall (i.e. at the same level as "guard").

The default entry_point option (first level, firewall) wins over the listener specific option, meaning that there is no way to keep a default entry point that works for all other listeners of the firewall but a specific for guard.
I think it should be the opposite, listener specific should win over defaults. WDYT?
