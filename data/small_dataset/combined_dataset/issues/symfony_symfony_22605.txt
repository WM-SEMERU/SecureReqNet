There is a memory leak in Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Security\FirewallMap, which leads to not autodestroy Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request object after the request has been proceeded. This object is quite big and uses many internal subobjects, and as a result this leads to an essential memory leak, which can affect long-lived applications like php-pm.
How to reproduce: create a default sample Symfony application, add a destructor for the Request class, add unset($request); at the end of web/app.php and make sure that this destructor is not called after unset().
With this fix the destructor is called immediately after unset(), and that means no memory leak for the Request object.
