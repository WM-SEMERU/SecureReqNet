Be careful about locales


Original issue 530 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-11T23:58:07.000Z:
There are places in the code that do something like
if ("SCRIPT".equals(tagName.toUpperCase())) {
.. rip out the script tag, do something to make everyone safe ...
}
Problem: If the Cajoler is running in the Turkish locale, then
"SCRIPT".equals("script".toUpperCase()) is false.  "i".toUpperCase() does
not return what you might expect: it returns a capital I with a dot on top
of it.
Impact: the Cajoler may be insecure in Turkey.
In general, you should be careful about locales.
One possible fix: replace all of these uses of uppercasing with a call to a
locale-independent uppercase method that does what you'd expect.
