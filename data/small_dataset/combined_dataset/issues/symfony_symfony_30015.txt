Autowiring services in multiple config files


Hey All,
I am using Symfony 4.2.2 and I stuck on a weird issue.
I am separating the services.yaml files under config/services/ directory but is not autowiring bundle services.
First things first, I have a bundle that autogenerates based on a config file some services
eg. in
config/packages/my_bundle.yaml
I have
my_bundle:
  service1:
    argument1: '@dependency1' 

  service2:
    argument1: '@dependency2'          

The above services are generated correctly and can be used inside the main symfony project if the services that they using it are all inside the config/services.yaml.
In case I separate them and move some of the services inside  config/services/*.yaml files it gets back with the following error:
Cannot autowire service "App/Service1": argument "$interface" of method "__construct()" references interface "Bundle/Interface" but no such service exists. You should maybe alias this interface to one of these existing services: service1, service2
services that implement the interface.
The most weird thing is that is working in one file but not if I separate them it doesn't so I am not quite sure if I haven't configured something correctly.
Full example below:
config/packages/my_bundle.yaml

my_bundle:
  service1:
    argument1: '@dependency1' 

  service2:
    argument1: '@dependency2'          


config/services/service1.yaml
services:
    _defaults:
        autowire: true
        autoconfigure: true
        public: false

       App/Service1:
           bind:
                $service: '@service1' 

config/services/service2.yaml
services:
    _defaults:
        autowire: true
        autoconfigure: true
        public: false

       App/Service2:
           bind:
                $service: '@service2' 


Thank in advance for your help or suggestions.
