App devs trust default mbedtls library options in Open Enclave


This story tracks due diligence and review tasks necessary for ensuring that the options that Open Enclave builds mbedtls are safe by default for a general user. This includes:

 #242 Update mbedtls_hardware_poll to use RDSEED
 #256 Remove support for arbitrary EC curves in mbedtls security
 #383 Evaluate use of MBEDTLS_THREADING_C & MBEDTLS_THREADING_PTHREAD flags
 #384 Review mbedtls module configuration options

This also has a dependency on #251 to ensure that we upgrade to the latest version of mbedtls.
