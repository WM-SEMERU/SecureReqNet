[deck.gl] some values on map not shaded


We have seen the issue where the legend is an integer type (ie. last bucket is values of 15-27) But the actual value on the chart is a float and is beyond the last bucket values (ie. in this case it was 27.56), the point/value is not rendered.
Need to make sure legend is in float as well (or is the same type as the metric being plotted)
Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!

 I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
 I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
 I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.
