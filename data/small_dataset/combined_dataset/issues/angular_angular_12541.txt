Current behavior
Current template sanitizer emits the same warning messages always.
WARNING: sanitizing HTML stripped some content (see http://g.co/ng/security#xss).

This is inconvenient when there are multiple insecure points. It's very difficult to look up the point in the template.
Expected behavior
Report security warnings with row and column in the template.
An idea:
WARNING: [my-cmp.component.html:3:5] sanitizing HTML stripped some content (see http://g.co/ng/security#xss).

Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions
What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?
To make debugging easy.
