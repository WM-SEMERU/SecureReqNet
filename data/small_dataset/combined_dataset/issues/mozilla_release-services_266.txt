use taskcluster secrets instead of variables in heroku


Sometimes we are having some downtime when forget to copy-paste correct secrets in Heroku (in Setting panel).
What happens is that we set this secrets correctly in staging but forget to setup on some Heroku applications in production. Then when we deploy to production we - hopefully - see errors in time before bigger damage is done. Also needed secrets are different between different applications.
The idea behind this issue is that we would read - at flask startup in settings.py - needed configuration from Taskcluster secrets. Then the only variables that we would need to set on Heroku is a temporary Taskcluster credentials.
Above architecture would also allow us to recycle credentials easier.
One thing which we would need to solve is that when we change this secrets we would need to restart all the applications that require it.
