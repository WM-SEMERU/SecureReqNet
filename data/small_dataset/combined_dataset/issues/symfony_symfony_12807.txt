This new firewall allows you to block long running sessions.
When the session cookie is valid until the browser is closed (cookie_lifetime = 0), but the user left the browser open for a long time, the session will be invalidated if the max_idle_time is exceeded. The max_idle_time value should be lesser or equal than the one from session.gc_maxlifetime.
If an expiration_url is set, the user agent will be redirected to this URL after the session invalidation. If this parameter is not set, a SessionExpiredException will be thrown.
