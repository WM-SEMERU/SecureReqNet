When I try to inspect an element on a page where I have opened developer tools beforehand (or because I already inspected the page earlier on), the developer tools are not brought to the front.

Right click on an element and choose "inspect element"
Make sure a window (another program or just Brave) overlaps the Developer Tools
Right click again and choose "inspect element" again
