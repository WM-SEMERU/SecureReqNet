Should serviceAccountLookup be set to true in kubernetes apiserver


Forked from #23959 (comment).
Setting serviceAccountLookup to true ensures that we verify that the service account tokens mentioned in the request are actually present in etcd.
Without it we just verify that the token is valid. That check breaks if a service account is used after it is deleted.
@liggitt mentioned that we should set it to true in kubernetes apiserver (we dont currently). Openshift sets it to true. He also mentioned that @erictune had some performance concerns for setting it to true.
What do others think?
