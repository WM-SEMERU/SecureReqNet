PHPUnit test freezes when testing ChoiceCommand with multiSelect enabled


Symfony version(s) affected: Console 4.2.3
Description
This is a standalone Symfony Console project. I have one simple test, to test a command that requires input. I use the setInputs method in the test on $commandTester and input 6 answers there for the 6 questions that will be asked. However, the test hangs at the ChoiceQuestion with multiSelect enabled ($question->setMultiselect(true);), causing PHP to use a lot of processing power (CPU usage) and the Terminal ends up using a lot of RAM.
How to reproduce
Make a simple test like this one:
<?php

namespace Dockr\Tests\Command;

use MyApp\Commands\MyCoolCommand;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Application;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Tester\CommandTester;

class MyCoolCommandTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testExecute()
    {
        $application = new Application();
        $application->add(new MyCoolCommand);

        $command = $application->find('do_cool_stuff');

        $commandTester = new CommandTester($command);
        $commandTester->setInputs(['This', 'This', 'This', 'This', 'This', 'This']);
        $commandTester->execute(['command' => $command->getName()]);
    }
}

And make sure that there is one multiSelect question ($question->setMultiselect(true);). The question should hang at the $questionHelper->ask($input, $output, $question) call.
Please note: This command works perfectly fine when running the command manually, only fails when running it via a test like above.
