Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserProviderInterface::refreshUser() does not declare that implementations may throw a UsernameNotFoundException, although a) it makes sense, as the user could have been deleted since the last load, and b) the ContextListener already handles the UsernameNotFoundException. So it looks like someone thought of this, but simply forgot the annotation.
Unsure if this is a bugfix or a feature, but as it doesn't change executed code, master should be soon enough.
