several performance issues with muon based on C69


Test plan

Launch Brave on macOS
Resize the window a bunch. Try to do it fast and ensure that behavior matches our existing live version (0.23.107)
Try loading a lot of tabs and bookmarks (as @LaurenWags describes in #15202 (comment)) and quit / relaunch. Performance should match 0.23.107

Description
There seems to be a few performance issues with muon that includes C69. So far we've noticed the following area's that seem a bit slower/jankier compared to the current 0.23.107 6f2fc65 build which is based on 68.0.3440.84:

window resizing
application launch time
detaching tabs from a window

Steps to Reproduce

install 0.23.107 6f2fc65 and resize the window several times (note the performance)
install 0.23.206 80a5ac1 and resize the window several times (note the performance)

You'll notice a big difference in performance between 0.23.107 and 0.23.206 when it comes to resizing windows.
Actual result:
Resizing windows on 0.23.206 80a5ac1 is a lot slower/jankier compared to 0.23.107 6f2fc65 which feels a lot more snappier. Definitely seems like the performance has decreased with 0.23.206 80a5ac1.
Expected result:
Resizing windows on 0.23.206 80a5ac1 should be as performant as 0.23.107 6f2fc65.
