Hi!
This builds on top of #30008. In fact, I would be perfectly happy if @G15N pulled in my commit into his branch and finished it on his PR (we would close this one then). I just wanted to make sure the 2nd half got done.
This adds 2 things:

A new AmqpRoutingKeyStamp that allows you to configure the routing key
The ability to define multiple queues on an AMQP transport, each bound to 0 or more routing keys.

It also fixes a few things I'm pretty sure were wrong - specifically the attributes and flags configuration for a queue were also sent when publishing a message. I don't think that makes sense: when you're publishing a message, you have no idea what queue you will go to. These 2 options are now NOT configurable for each message, which makes me wonder if we should add 2 new stamps for these, or merge onto one bigger AmqpConfigurationStamp class.
Cheers!
