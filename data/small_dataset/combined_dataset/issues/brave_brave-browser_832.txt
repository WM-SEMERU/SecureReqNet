Consider adding less elevated read only extension permissions


MetaMask would like this:
Somehow allow us to remove the read-and-modify-all-websites permission
- Maybe a CSP policy that permits a script w/ a given hash to __.
- subscribe to page window.postMessage from extension background
- allow webpage to open a socket to some protocol? (like connect external but not
tied to a specific extension)
- Using the Permissions API to provide an API?
- Allow `connectExternal` in extension manifest to point to `*`
- Any other conceivable WebExtension permission for â€œproviding an API to sites
