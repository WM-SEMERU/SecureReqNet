Hi guys!
Problem: From inside a voter, if you want to check an attribute from another voter, you can't do that easily. You need the security.access.decision_manager service, but injecting it (or security.authorization_checker) causes a circular reference exception. So, you need to inject the entire container.
Solution: With this, if your voter implements the new AccessDecisionManagerAwareInterface, then setAccessDecisionManager is called on it before vote().
This allows code like:
public function vote(TokenInterface $token, $object, array $attributes)
{
    if ($this->accessDecisionManager->decide($token, array('ROLE_ADMIN')) {
        return self::ACCESS_GRANTED;
    }

    // ... your normal logic
}
Thanks!
