[WIP DO NOT MERGE] Configure hiding table columns through config.js file


Description
We want to support hiding table columns, specifically in metrics table, through config file so that users can make the relevant bits hidden as per their organization. Current work will support the metrics table but can be extended to any table with minimal work in future.
Config file will take the key of the metrics column from metrics.js file for the sake of minimal changes and simplicity of development.
Problem: The keyboard list in the UI is not consistent across views such as in the instance wizard and in the register template form. There is also no way to custom about url/text and doc title and help URL in the UI.
Root Cause: The list is hardcoded in the UI allowing no centralised configuration.
Solution: Introduce a new config.js file installed at the /usr/share/cloudstackmanagement/webapp/config.js location. The config.js allows configurable keyboard list, about url/text, doc title,  and help URL.
