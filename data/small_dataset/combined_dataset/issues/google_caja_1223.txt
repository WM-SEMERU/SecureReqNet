form.submit() can be used to automatically redirect to URLs allowed by the URL policy


Original issue 1223 created by felix8a on 2010-06-14T23:02:08.000Z:
right now there's nothing preventing a gadget from calling form.submit() and submitting a form without user intervention, which means a gadget could possibly redirect to arbitrary URLs without user intervention.
in the past, caja rewrote <form> elements so that there's always an onsubmit='return false'.  however,
1, this doesn't seem to be happening anymore.
2, it doesn't prevent form.submit(), because form.submit() does not trigger onsubmit handlers.
the risk can be mitigated with a url policy that denies malicious URLs, or rewrites URLs to go through a proxy that filters malicious content.
this is related to bug 1129 and bug 881.
I'm going to try to fix this with a modified version of isProcessingEvent___ handling.
