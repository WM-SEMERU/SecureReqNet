Upgrade third party libraries with security vulnerabilities


Motivation
The Pulsar distribution includes some third-party libraries with security vulnerabilities.

jackson-databind-2.9.7

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19360
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19361
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19362


commons-beanutils-1.7.0, commons-beanutils-core-1.8.0

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0114



Modifications

Upgraded jackson related libraries to 2.9.8. The jackson used in pulsar-sql can not be upgraded to 2.9.x, so upgraded jackson-databind to 2.8.11.3 (cf. #2978).
Upgraded the version of commons-configuration from 1.6 to 1.10. commons-beanutils and commons-beanutils-core were installed because commons-configuration-1.6 depends on these, but these dependencies are optional in commons-configuration-1.10.
