Address authorization TODOs in dispatcher


There are some TODOs related to authorization in the dispatcher's RPC handlers:
// TODO(diogo): Ensure we only allow nodes to change their own tasks
// TODO(diogo): Ensure we only allow nodes to change their own heartbeat status
// TODO(diogo): Ensure we only allow nodes to change their own Session

I think UpdateTaskStatus also needs a check to make sure agents can only update tasks assigned to them.
I'm filing this issue for tracking to make sure we don't forget to add these checks, since they are important for the security properties of the system.
