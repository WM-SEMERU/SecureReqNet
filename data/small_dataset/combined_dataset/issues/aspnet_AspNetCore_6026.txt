Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI is not support v2.0 endpoint?


I want to use 'AddAzureADBearer' method with v2.0 endpoint (from Application Registration Portal), but it seems to be not supported.
Do I have to use this sample? https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2/blob/master/TodoListService/Extensions/AzureAdAuthenticationBuilderExtensions.cs
