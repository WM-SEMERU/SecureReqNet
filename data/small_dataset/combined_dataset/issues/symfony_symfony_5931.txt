[Security] Don't redirect when the AuthenticationException is thrown


Hi,
when the AuthenticationException or AccessDeniedException are thrown, the ExceptionListener catches it and immediately redirects to the login page.
Sometimes this is not wanted (for example in ajax request to a secured page), but I couldn't find a way to disable it, so it would be nice to have one :)
