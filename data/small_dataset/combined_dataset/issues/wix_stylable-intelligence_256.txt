Hi,
Kenneth here from the VS Code team.
Your extension is affected by https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/11/26/event-stream, and we have blocked your extension.
In order to enable your extension again the workflow is:

 Fix the extension, submit an update to the marketplace
 Send mail to VSMarketplace@microsoft.com and kennau@microsoft.com and notify us.
We will verify that the extension is okay
Our marketplace will publish the extension again and we'll remove the extension from the blocklist
