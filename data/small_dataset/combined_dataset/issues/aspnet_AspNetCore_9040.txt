Workaround for Preview3 ANCM/HB installer problem not working


@anurse @shirhatti The workaround of ...

Uninstall all hosting bundles.
Install the Preview2 hosting bundle (dotnet-hosting-3.0.0-preview-19075-0444-win.exe) at a command prompt with OPT_NO_SHAREDFX=1 OPT_NO_RUNTIME=1.
Stop was/start w3svc. (Tried a full system restart, too.)

... isn't working.

The Module DLL 'C:\Program Files\IIS\Asp.Net Core Module\V2\aspnetcorev2.dll' could not be loaded due to a configuration problem. The current configuration only supports loading images built for a AMD64 processor architecture.

Advice? ... manually delete modules and try again?
