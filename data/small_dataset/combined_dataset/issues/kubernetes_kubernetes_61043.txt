PodSecurityPolicy allowedHostPaths does not effectively restrict to a subpath


the allowedHostPaths feature limits what paths can be specified in a hostPath volume, but does not restrict symlink creation and traversal within that subpath
To prevent this, either of the following are required:

limit hostPath use to read only volumes (in progress in #58647)
limit hostPath use to exact path matches

Until those changes are made, PodSecurityPolicy objects designed to limit container permissions must completely disable hostPath volumes
