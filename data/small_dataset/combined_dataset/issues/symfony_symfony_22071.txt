What is the recommended way to do per-firewall guard configuration options? Just add logic based on the request in the Guard? My current use case is redirection settings. Based on what firewall you are using a Guard from you might want different redirection to occur. It would be nice to define some configuration options like this per firewall like you can with the form_login approach.
Currently it seems like the only way would be to add logic to the onAuthenticationSuccess() and onAuthenticationFailure() methods and inspect the Request object. Maybe it should stay that way due to the generic nature of the Guard in general? Thoughts?
