kubeadm alpha phase certs renew all should also update certs in KubeConfig files


FEATURE REQUEST
Versions
kubeadm version v1.12.5
Environment:

Kubernetes version v1.12.5
hardware configuration: 1 Master (VM), 2 Nodes (Hardware)
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS (Xenial Xerus)
Kernel (e.g. uname -a): Linux node1 4.4.0-141-generic #167-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 5 10:40:15 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

What happened?
3 of my clusters are now 1 year old. As some certs are issued with 1 year validity the cluster stopped working properly. I've upgrade the clusters from 1.10.12 to 1.11.6 and 1.12.5 before the certificates reached their expiration date.
I've experienced several problems:
Even with Certificate Rotation enabled, kubelet.conf points to outdated certs

As Certificate Rotation has been enabled in one of the upgrades (not sure when), the pem file /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem was rotated correctly, but

on Nodes: client-certificate and client-key in /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf still pointed to /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client.*
on Master: client-certificate-data and client-key-data  in /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf still contained the certificate which will outdate soon.
I had to manually update client-certificate-data and client-key-data on all nodes and all clusters

Alternatively one could use sudo kubeadm alpha phase kubeconfig kubelet to regenerate this file on Master and all Nodes!





Certificate Rotation dos not update apiserver/etcd/front-proxy-client certs

Certificate Rotation does not seem to update any of the other certificates on Master, i.e.

apiserver*
etcd*
front-proxy-client



The Command kubeadm alpha phase certs renew all does not update KubeConfig files

I've manually issued sudo kubeadm alpha phase certs renew all on master which renews all expired certs in /etc/kubernetes/pki which is fine, BUT

KubeConfig files like the following are not updated:

/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
/etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf




Therefore the static pods are still using the old certificate, so i had to use sudo kubeadm alpha phase kubeconfig all --apiserver-advertise-address=x.x.x.x

Additionally one have to restart the static pods (or easier the master server) to reread the new certificates.
It even gets worse if certificates are expired already. In this case you can kubectl -n kube-system delete pod kube-apiserver-mater which does seem to work, but in reality the pod never got restarted - I had to stop and start the container with docker stop/start.



What you expected to happen?

I think there is not much one could do about the first issue, if the config file is wrong, how should the cluster inform an admin...
Certificate rotation is responsible for kubelet, so there is also not much one could do about the second issue
For certs renew I would suggest to update the documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-certs/) and state when to run this command (once a year). On the first sight it is not clear if this command has to be executed on master and all nodes or just on master,...
I'd also suggest that the command either updates the KubeConfig files too or at least give some hints to the user that he should do it manually. It should also suggest to restart the static pods after updating the KubeConfig files
kubeadm alpha phase kubeconfig should either restart the static pods after config has been written or inform the user to do so.

Best regards
Andreas
