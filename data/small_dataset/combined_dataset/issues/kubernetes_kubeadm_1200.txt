RFE: Optionally Encrypt Certs as Secrets on `init` use token on `join`

The general UX for standing up an HA control plane is a bit manual for most consumers.  There has been a desire for folks to be able to store control plane certs as secrets but there is a broader security concern that these secrets are not encrypted, or any token could be obtained through the cluster itself.

Proposal:

ControlPlane 1:

kubeadm init --upload-certs
...
Encrypts the certs locally (using pick your favorite method) and uploads ~= sealed-secret
Output a token/key (file or command line)
....


ControlPlane 2:

kubeadm join --control-plane --download-certs=key





Certs are stored as secrets but the key is only created on init and used on join.  The key is never to be stored on cluster.
