Add kms encryption key as argument for cdk bootstrap


The cdk bootstrap command creates the following resource in CloudFormation:
  StagingBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      AccessControl: Private
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
          - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
              SSEAlgorithm: aws:kms

I have not seen any option to specify the KMS key to be used. Is there a way to do so?
Cheers!
