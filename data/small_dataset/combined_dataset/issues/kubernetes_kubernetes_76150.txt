[UI] CPU and Memory reserved percentage display not updated when switching between clusters


What happened:
When moving between two clusters, the percentage of CPU and Memory Reserved displays do not update and retain the value from the initial cluster.  I've observed this with clusters that have Grafana/Prometheus monitoring enabled.
What you expected to happen:
When I switch to a different cluster the reserved CPU and Memory percentage displays should reflect the values for that cluster.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Using a Rancher install with multiple clusters, switch back and forth between two clusters that have monitoring enabled.  You should observe that the n% displays for CPU and Memory do not update when changing between clusters.
Changing to a cluster that does not have monitoring enabled seems to "clear" the values.
Anything else we need to know?:
Rancher is awesome.  Thanks for all the hard work.
