ClassNotFoundException: Attempted to load class "TwigBundle"


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.4
Description
When create project using composer for just skeleton and later you also require symfony/profiler-pack for dev only, it has dependency on TwigBundle.
But in config/Bundles.php you get following:
return [
    Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\FrameworkBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    Symfony\Bundle\TwigBundle\TwigBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    Symfony\Bundle\WebProfilerBundle\WebProfilerBundle::class => ['dev' => true, 'test' => true],
];
Web profiler is required for for dev and test only, but twig is required for all. The problems arises when you want to deploy this application with composer install --no-dev

How to reproduce


create project in current directory
composer create-project symfony/skeleton .


add profiler
composer require --dev symfony/profiler-pack


Now, you have to deploy it for production. You can use different folder or different server. Make it ready for deployment for production by changing the .env file for APP_ENV=prod


finally, perform
 composer install --no-dev


You will get the above error for twig dependency.
Possible Solution
I can't guide you the solution but one thing I want to mention is this is going to be complicated. Because in website-skelton, you need need TwigBundle for all, but in skeleton, you need it for dev and test only if required with profiler.
Additional context
I faced this problem yesterday while deploying my application. And now, I tried to reproduce this bug and I was able to reproduce it. Here is stakeoverflow thread of this problem that was solved by manually editing config/bundles.php for TwigBundle for dev and test only and then moving twig.yaml files to appropriate folders.
