Bulk moving issues to the AspNetCore, Extensions, and EntityFrameworkCore repos


As a follow-up to #320, we will start bulk moving issues from the many 'smaller' repos into the few, new 'mondo' repos. We will continue to use labels to signify various product areas and sub-features to make it reasonably easy to locate issues of interest.
Please use aspnet/AspNetCore#3598 for discussions.
