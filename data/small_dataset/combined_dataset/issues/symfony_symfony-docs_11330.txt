[WIP] Create a migration guide in the docs.


The general idea is to provide advice on how to migrate
an existing application over to Symfony using some
proven approaches.
The page should provide around 3 alternatives and some
discussion when they might be suitable as well as
additional resources like videos on this topics from
the official Symfony YouTube-channel.
