Ideas on ways to try to confuse the runtime HTML sanitizer


Original issue 614 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-14T01:20:40.000Z:
I thought I'd write down some of the ideas we had for trying to confuse the
runtime HTML sanitizer in Domita into allowing us to put in blacklisted
content (e.g., scripts).  These are ideas we brainstormed but ran out of
time to try/test.

SGML SHORTTAGs are fun.  You might not expect it, but the following
could possibly be interpreted as HTML markup (they might all mean the same
thing):

<FOO><BAR>
<FOO/BAR/
<FOO<BAR>

Some browsers seem to interpret backticks as an additional quoting
character, e.g., these may be equivalent:

<FOO ATTR="bar baz">
<FOO ATTR=bar baz>

Try putting null characters (e.g., "\0") into attribute values.  Does
this confuse the sanitizer or the browser into ending an attribute value at
a place where Domita didn't expect?  The idea is to confuse Domita about
where attribute values start and end.  The core security assumption that
Domita makes is that since it ensures all attribute values start with "
(double-quote), the only way to cause the browser to end an attribute value
is with a " (double-quote), & (ampersand), < (less-than), or >
(greater-than).  If this assumption is false, then there may be a serious
attack.  Consider, e.g.,

<A ALT="harmless\0  SCRIPT=javascript:alert(1) ignored=ignored">
I don't think this will actually work, but imagine if Domita thought that
this contains one long attribute but the browser thinks that this contains
three attributes, the second of which is a SCRIPT attribute.

Similar idea to try to falsify that assumption: Try Unicode quote
characters.
Try %-encoding of a double-quote..
Try ending the attribute with one byte of a multi-byte escape (or a
surrogate codepoint) so that when Domita appends a " (double-quote), the
browser thinks that the one byte and the " are part of a single multi-byte
escape that is interpreted as something other than a double-quote.
Try putting UTF-7 in the attribute.  Can you introduce the UTF-7
encoding of a double-quote?  What can you do with that?
Try slashes (see SGML shorttags).
Check out http://ha.ckers.com/xss.html and http://ha.ckers.com/charset.html.

Suggested work item: Check these out to see whether there is anything crazy
here you can do.  Need to understand this on all browsers you support or
that Caja can run on.
