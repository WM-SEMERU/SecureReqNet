Reverse proxy is a convenient feature of most web servers (Apache, nginx). While these solutions are very powerful and stable, it can be easier to configure the rules in the PHP code directly.
This is identical to "Redirection without custom controller" except that instead of returning a redirect response, the contents is directly fetched.
If necessary, HTTP cache can be specified in the http_client configuration.
Use cases:

Exposing a file from a remote server (robots.txt, ads.txt)
Loading an ESI/SSI from a remote server

Usage:
# config/routes/proxy.yaml

humans:
    path: /humans.txt
    controller: Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\ProxyController
    methods: [GET]
    defaults:
        url: https://robots-txt.org/humans.txt
        options:
            timeout: 1
        extraResponseHeaders:
            Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public
Example in symfony-demo : symfony/demo@master...GromNaN:proxycontroller
Feature not supported yet:

Error handling : what happens when the remote server does not return a 200 or timeouts ?
Pass headers from the request to the remote request and from the remote response to the response (Auth, Cookies).
Allow dynamic url using path placeholders.
The responseHeaders option could be a more generic feature on routing to add cache control config to any route.
