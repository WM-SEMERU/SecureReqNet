proposal: x/crypto/hkdf: Allow skipping the extract stage


RFC5869 suggests that the extract stage of HKDF's extract-and-expand process can be skipped if there is sufficient entropy in the input key material. Would it be worth providing a separate function for initializing the hkdf struct directly?
