spec: clarify section on initialization order


See #22326 for a discussion of a specific example and how the spec might be unclear. See specifically #22326 (comment) .
Issues with the section on initialization order:

The very first sentence may imply an algorithm that is different from the one explained by 2nd, more detailed paragraph.
The section talks about declaration order, but variables named _ are "never declared" (yet they are processed for initialization order like any other variable).
The section could use one or two more examples.
