Current behavior
Since the introduction of html sanitization with rc2, html5 video elements get removed when binding html to the innerHTML property of an element.
Expected/desired behavior
Video elements should be retained just like img elements.
What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?
I need to incorporate external html into my app and if sanitization removes video elements I need to turn it off, which causes security issues.
Please tell us about your environment:
