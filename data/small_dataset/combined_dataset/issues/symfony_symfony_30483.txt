[Serializer] SerializedName based on groups


Description
It would be helpful to be able to change the serialized name based on the serialization group.
Example
class Person
{
    /**
     * @SerializedName(name="address1", groups={"registration"})
     * @SerializedName(name="address2", groups={"update"})
     * @Groups({"registration", "update", "view"})
     * @var string
     */
    public $address;
}
