[Navigation Item] Render inline svg in an image tag


Problem
In the Item component svg strings are rendered inline with dangerouslySetInnerHTML. This can lead to an XSS vulnerability where if an svg with scripts is rendered on a page, they will be executed.
Solution
We can convert the svg string to a data URI and display it in an img tag where it doesn’t execute scripts when rendered.
I propose that the logic that implements this lives within the Icon component. This way other users that render svg strings can do so safely. The Icon component would have a color prop to recolour the image when the item’s state changes (hover/focus/selected).
Doing this also decouples Navigation Item from Icon as Item relies on the implementation Icon returning an svg tag to re-style. By passing in the fill colour instead of having these states in Navigation.scss, the icon that Item is rendering doesn’t break if it’s not an svg tag.
