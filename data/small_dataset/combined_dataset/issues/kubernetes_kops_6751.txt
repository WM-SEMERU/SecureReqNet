a kops flag.
1.12.7
3. What cloud provider are you using?
AWS
4. What commands did you run?  What is the simplest way to reproduce this issue?
kops rolling-update cluster
5. What happened after the commands executed?
On Demand Instances were rolled, but spot instances were not.
6. What did you expect to happen?
All Instances to roll
9. Anything else do we need to know?
Had previously migrated cluster to use Mixed Instance Policy using a custom build of kops 1.12 alpha 3 including PR #6732.
After release of beta 3, i updated cluster. Terraform plan shows changes to each IGs aws_launch_template. However The rolling-update output shows only some of the instnaces per IG need updates.

The nodes that did not update are all spot instances.
I think the issues may be that findAutoscalingGroupLaunchConfiguration() is only comparing LaunchTemplateName and needs to also compare Version.
