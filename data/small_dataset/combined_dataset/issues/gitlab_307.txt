Perhaps it's intentional, but the blog post for the 6.9 release mentions using bin/upgrade.rb (which we've used in the past and love) and it's not in the 6.9 branch:

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/6-9-stable/bin

Steps to reproduce:

* Checkout 6-9-stable branch
* Attempt to run `sudo -u git -H ruby bin/upgrade.rb`

Expected behavior:

* Upgrade script runs

Observed behavior:

* Error about the file missing

Logs/screenshots/output:

* `ruby: No such file or directory -- bin/upgrade.rb (LoadError)`

Output of checks:

* N/A. (All checks pass)

Possible Fixes:

* Bring back the upgrade script, if appropriate.
