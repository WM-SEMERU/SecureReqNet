Protos: Move backpointer to Entry


First step of clarifying what to store in leafs. See  #758 (comment) and related to  #387
message Entry {
  // commitment is a cryptographic commitment to arbitrary data.
  bytes commitment = 1;
  // authorized_keys is the set of keys allowed to sign updates for this entry.
  repeated PublicKey authorized_keys = 2;
  // previous contains the backpointer to the prev. leaf (sha256)
  bytes previous = 3;
}
Clients need it to verify the history of changes as presented by servers (and signed by monitors); Entry is the thing clients see and receive from the server.
