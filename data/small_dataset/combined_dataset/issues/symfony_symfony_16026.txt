Redirect authenticated with RememberMeToken user to login form after access check in controller


I have custom voter for check access to admin of Company entity
public function mainAction(Request $request, $id)
{
    ....

    $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted('admin', $company);

    ....
}
If AccessDeniedException is thrown i get redirected to login page even if user is logged in (with RememberMeToken). Is this expected behaviour?
I want get 403 error page for authenticated user and redirect to login page for anonymous user. What is right way to do this? Throw AccessDeniedHttpException instead?
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/ExceptionListener.php#L122 this part of code check that user should be not "anonymous" and not "remember me". I am not sure why we need remember me check here?
