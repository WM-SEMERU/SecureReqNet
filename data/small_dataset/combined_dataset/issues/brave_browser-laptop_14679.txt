external protocol prompt does not appear on about: pages


STR:

go to about:newtab (or just open a new tab)
enter 'mailto:test' in the url bar
note that the mail app opens without showing a permission prompt

whereas if you do step 2 on a page such as google.com, the permission prompt appears as expected.
