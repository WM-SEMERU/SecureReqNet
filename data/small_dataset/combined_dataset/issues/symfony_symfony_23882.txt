This PR is an alternative approach to #19033. Due to a behavioral change that could break a lot of applications and websites, I've decided to trigger a deprecation instead of actually changing the behavior as that can be done for 4.0.
Whenever a user object is considered changed (AbstractToken::hasUserChanged) when setting a new user object after refreshing, it will now throw a deprecation, paving the way for a behavioral change in 4.0. The idea is that in 4.0 Symfony will simply trigger a logout when this case is encountered.
