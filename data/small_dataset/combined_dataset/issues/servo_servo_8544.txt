Browser API: expose SSL info (securitychange event)


mozbrowsersecuritychange properties: https://github.com/paulrouget/mozBrowserAPI/blob/master/BrowserAPI.md#the-mozbrowsersecuritychange-event
Could someone describe what needs to be done to expose SSL information (no ssl, non valid cert, valid cert, mixed content, â€¦)? At least, we'd like to start with basic info: ssl or no ssl.
