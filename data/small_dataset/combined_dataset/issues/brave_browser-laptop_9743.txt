(reported by email by the folks at lgtm.com)
In general, cross-origin anchor elements with target="_blank" create a security risk as described in https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/. This is solved by adding
rel="noopener" to all links with target="_blank", which nulls the window.opener object.
I don't think this is currently exploitable in Brave because, based on experimentation, window.opener is automatically set to null when the opener is a chrome-extension:// URL. However this for defense in depth we should probably add rel="noopener" anyway.
