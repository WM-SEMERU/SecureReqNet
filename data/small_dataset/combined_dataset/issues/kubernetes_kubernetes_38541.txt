Harden addons & system pods


Our system pods should run using security best practices, both to enhance cluster security and serve as examples of best practices to users. We should audit all our system pod Dockerfiles, and make sure all security features are enabled with custom profiles when possible.
Low hanging fruit:

Run with the default seccomp profile
Run as non-root (& disallow privilege escalation)
ReadOnlyRootFilesystem
Avoid unnecessary HostPath volumes

More advanced:

Reduce depednencies in the base image (#40248)
Custom seccomp profile
Custom AppArmor profile
Drop unneeded capabilities (e.g. CAP_NET_RAW)
Run with restricted service accounts (done)
