Template grammar issue in comment for auth options


Here:
https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/StarterWeb-CSharp/Startup.cs#L107
                    // If your application needs to do authenticate single users, add your user validation below.
Should probably be:
                    // If your application needs to authenticate single users, add your user validation below.
