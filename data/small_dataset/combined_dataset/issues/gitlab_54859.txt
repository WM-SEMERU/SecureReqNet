- [ ] check on production if we managed to migrate all records
- [ ] check on production if we can safely remove columns
- [ ] check in sentry if there are no exceptions related to new encryption mechanisms
- [ ] check how often we had to use fallback-plaintext strategy
- [ ] add plain-text columns to ignored columns
- [ ] remove columns in a migration following our docs
- [ ] done.
