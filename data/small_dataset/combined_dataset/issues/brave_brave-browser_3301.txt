Restrict custom-headers for partners


Test plan

install 0.59.35 Chromium: 72.0.3626.81 (which doesn't have the fix)
launch 0.59.35 using BRAVE_REFERRALS_SERVER=laptop-updates-pre.brave.com
visit brave.com and you should see X-Brave-Access-Key: key in the headers
uninstall 0.59.35 Chromium: 72.0.3626.81 & install 0.60.44 Chromium: 72.0.3626.109
launch 0.60.44 using BRAVE_REFERRALS_SERVER=laptop-updates-pre.brave.com
you shouldn't see any X-Brave-Access-Key: headers when visiting brave.com
visit marketwatch.com & barrons.com and ensure you receive X-Brave-Partner: dowjones
visit cheddar.com and ensure that you receive x-brave-partner: cheddar
visit coinbase.com and ensure that you receive x-brave-partner: coinbase

Also go through the Dow Jones flow for both MW & Barrons using 0.60.44 Chromium: 72.0.3626.109 and ensure that you can redeem a promotional code and create an account.
Background
When creating the referral program, we designed it so that partners can send custom headers. The intention is so that partners can detect a user is using Brave and customize the experience for them (ex: allow them to read articles or use the service for free, etc)
An example of the headers (which are all X-Brave-Partner) can be seen here:
https://laptop-updates.brave.com/promo/custom-headers
This design and implementation was originally security reviewed (and approved) by @tomlowenthal here (private repo link):
brave/internal#250 (comment)
Description
We should restrict this list so that it can ONLY use this list for sending the X-Brave-Partner header. No custom header names should be allowed
