### Summary

(RememberMe)Session of at least LDAP Users (maybe also regular users) is not invalidated if the account is expired.
Eventually the LDAP Server does not output enough information (can not be tested)

### Steps to reproduce

Login to Gitlab and tick the "remember me" Box after login.
Having a LDAP Account from an external LDAP service which expires after login (i.e. managed by phpldapadmin)

Tested with an account which expired 11 days ago.

You can still browse the projects, change your profile and so on.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Session is not invalidated

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

* Invalidate session if account has been expired

OR

* Periodically check if account has been expired
