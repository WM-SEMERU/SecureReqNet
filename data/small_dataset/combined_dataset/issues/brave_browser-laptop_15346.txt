Make brave unusable to encourage updating


This PR replaces the newtab page with the notice to update Brave and
makes the urlbar unusable.
Test plan:

Launch Brave without brave-core installed
You should see a notice to update brave.
Clicking on it should download Brave.
The urlbar should not be usable.
With brave-core now installed, launch the old Brave again.
Now you should see a notice to launch the newer Brave installation.
The urlbar should still be unusable.

Test plan for disabling tab restoration:

Open previous version of muon brave and open some tabs/windows
Update to this version
You should not see any of your tabs/windows restored
