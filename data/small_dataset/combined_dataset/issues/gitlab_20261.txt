## Description

We should make sure that permissions for manual actions aligns with expectations of developers, especially for protect branches. 

## Proposal

Treat manual actions like a repo write.

Example: If the `master` branch is protected, only people with full permission to that branch can trigger a manual action on that branch.

## UX

~~Hiding any controls to whom is not allowed to~~

Show the action as disabled, and clearly let the user know why they can't do it with a tooltip.

Tooltip should state: `Action not possible due to protected branch`

### Documentation blurb

Manual actions now require the same permissions as a repository write, allowing control over who can trigger manual actions. For example, triggering a manual deploy job to production from the master branch can now be restricted to a narrower set of users with access to commit.
