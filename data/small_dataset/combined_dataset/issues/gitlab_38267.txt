### Summary

There is a cross-site scripting XSS attack when selecting an author filter in the issue search bar when the user's profile name has malicious script in it.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Visit https://gitlab.com/profile
2. Edit your Name to include the following text `" onload="alert('hi')">`
3. Visit https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/
4. In the filter bar type 'author:' and select your profile.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?
JavaScript alert hi appears

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?
Malicious script should be encoded correctly in the alt tag of the avatar as well as the inner html.
