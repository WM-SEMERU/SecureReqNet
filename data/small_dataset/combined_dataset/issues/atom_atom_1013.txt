Add some security precautions to package installation



 When installing a package, display a warning dialog that describes how packages have the capability of being malicious.
 Link GitHub identities closely with packages (will be easy because everything in the package store will be hosted on GitHub.)
 Ability to flag package as malicious and convey this message to users who have installed package.
 Possibly Log I/O, shelling, keychain access, etc... so people can see what is going on without their knowledge.
