Generate kubeconfig as well as tokens for service accounts


Mentioned in todays community meeting by @smarterclayton during @liggitt ServiceAccount demo.
Should something generate a kubeconfig file with the token in it, for each service account?
This would allow me to simplify the code in cluster/saltbase/salt/kube-addons/kube-addons.sh which creates secrets to just create service accounts.
Would this be the TokenController, or some new controller?
Would the kubeconfig go into a separate secret, or the same secret as the bare token?

if same, then is ServiceAccountSecret still the right secret type?
if different, is it annoying to have so many volumes?
if same, limited control over location of each?

Given that there is now a "file format" for tokens, should we just extend the kubeconfig format to support a tokenFilename field?  If we did that, is there any need to put the kubeconfig in a secret, since it just references secrets?
What should be the canonical location where the automounter puts a kubeconfig file, so that clients don't have to specify a flag?
