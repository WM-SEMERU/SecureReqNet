### Description

In **Settings > CI/CD > General** we have an entry that shows the token used by runners in order to checkout the project when executing jobs. This token is shown in clear-text, so anyone looking at your screen can see it.

This is possibly harmful when doing demos and recordings, since a view of the screen is publicly available.

### Proposal

Change the field to be masked by default (arbitrary fixed value is 20 `*`), and add a button to show the content on request. It is something similar to what we have for Secret Variables.

When clicking the **Reveal Value** button, the field shows the content in clear-text, and the button switches to **Hide Value** to allow masking it again.

**Hidden value**: `********************`  
**Revealed value**: the token
