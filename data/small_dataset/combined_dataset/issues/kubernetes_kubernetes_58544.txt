oidc authentication: switch to v2 of coreos/go-oidc


Switch to v2 of coreos/go-oidc, which uses square/go-jose to verify tokens and supports more signing algorithms.
Most of this PR removes dependencies used by the older version of github.com/coreos/go-oidc, and updates vendor files.
This PR has been tested against tokens issued by Okta, Google, and CoreOS's dex.
Closes #57806
kube-apiserver: the OpenID Connect authenticator can now verify ID Tokens signed with JOSE algorithms other than RS256 through the --oidc-signing-algs flag.
kube-apiserver: the OpenID Connect authenticator no longer accepts tokens from the Google v3 token APIs, users must switch to the "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token" endpoint.
