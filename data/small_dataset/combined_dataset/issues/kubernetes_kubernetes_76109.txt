Remove kube-proxy autocleanup for inactive modes


What type of PR is this?
/kind bug
What this PR does / why we need it:
kube-proxy attempts to clean up network rules for other modes (EG cleaning up iptables rules when running in IPVS mode). The complexity of this code is prone to bugs, and can delay kube-proxy's readiness between restarts.
This PR see KEP aims to remove auto-cleanup logic for non-current kube-proxy modes. In other words, kube-proxy will only automatically clean up rules relevant to its current mode. Users should use --cleanup or restart the node when switching between kube-proxy modes.
Which issue(s) this PR fixes:
Fixes #75408 (tracking issue)
Fixes #75360 (bug caused by auto-cleanup)
Special notes for your reviewer:
Worth discussing if we gate this behavior with a flag (EG --only-clean-current-mode), or outright GA. Outright GA is currently the plan.
Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
kube-proxy no longer automatically cleans up network rules created by running kube-proxy in other modes. If you are switching the mode that kube-proxy is in running in (EG: iptables to IPVS), you will need to run `kube-proxy --cleanup`, or restart the worker node (recommended) before restarting kube-proxy.

If you are not switching kube-proxy between different modes, this change should not require any action.
