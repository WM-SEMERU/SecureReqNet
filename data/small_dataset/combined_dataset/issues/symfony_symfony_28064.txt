CSRF token is invalid


Symfony version(s) affected: Symfony 3.4.9
Description
I have a strange problem with Symfony form csrf token validation (dev environment).
If I change the token manually using firebug and the CSRF token is invalid. I get an error "The CSRF token is invalid. Please try to resubmit the form." which is good and it should be doing that.
The problem is that after this happens, the form never gets submitted I always keep on getting the error  "The CSRF token is invalid. Please try to resubmit the form."
It gets into an infinate loop
This problem is also reported by other users on stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35208299/symfony-3-0-1-csrf-token-present-but-invalid
