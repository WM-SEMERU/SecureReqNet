<input> element leaks pointer to parent <form> node


Original issue 497 created by collin.jackson on 2008-06-11T17:14:02.000Z:
What steps will reproduce the problem?
Two Caja modules inside the same form tag can access each other's DOM using the "form" property
of input elements in side the Caja module.
What is the expected output?
Maybe we should provide guidance to containers not to do this. Or maybe we could verify that the
form tag is inside the module where the input element resides.
What do you see instead?
Full access between modules using the form tag.
