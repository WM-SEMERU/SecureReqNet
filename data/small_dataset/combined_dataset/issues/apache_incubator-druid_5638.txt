Fix HTTP OPTIONS request auth handling


Fixes #5588
This PR sets the AUTHORIZATION_CHECKED flag to true for all HTTP OPTIONS requests. This is handled in a new servlet filter (Druid has no explicit OPTIONS method handlers on its endpoints).
It seems that CORS pre-flight OPTIONS requests do not generally contain credentials headers:

https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-preflight-request
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778548

So a disableHttpOptionsAuthentication config is added to disable authentication checks on OPTIONS requests (authentication is required by default) to support CORS use cases.
