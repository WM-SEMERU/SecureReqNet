CLOUDSTACK-10333: Secure Live VM Migration for KVM


Description
This extends securing of KVM hosts to securing of libvirt on KVM
host as well for TLS enabled live VM migration. To simplify implementation
securing of host implies that both host and libvirtd processes are
secured with management server's CA plugin issued certificates.
FS: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Secure+Live+VM+Migration+for+KVM
Based on whether keystore and certificates files are available at
/etc/cloudstack/agent, the KVM agent determines whether to use TLS or
TCP based uris for live VM migration. It is also enforced that a secured
host will allow live VM migration to/from other secured host, and an
unsecured hosts will allow live VM migration to/from other unsecured
host only.
Post upgrade the KVM agent on startup will expose its security state
(secured detail is sent as true or false) to the managements server that
gets saved in host_details for the host. This host detail can be accesed
via the listHosts response, and in the UI unsecured KVM hosts will show
up with the host state of ‘unsecured’. Further, a button has been added
that allows admins to provision/renew certificates to KVM hosts and can
be used to secure any unsecured KVM host.
The cloudstack-setup-agent was modified to accept a new flag -s
which will reconfigure libvirtd with following settings:
listen_tcp=0
listen_tls=1
tcp_port="16509"
tls_port="16514"
auth_tcp="none"
auth_tls="none"
key_file = "/etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem"
cert_file = "/etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem"
ca_file = "/etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem"

For a connected KVM host agent, when the certificate are
renewed/provisioned a background task is scheduled that waits until all
of the agent tasks finish after which libvirt process is restarted and
finally the agent is restarted via AgentShell.
There are no API or DB changes.
Types of changes

 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)
 New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
 Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
 Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)
 Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)

Screenshots (if appropriate):
Unsecured KVM hosts when are Up and connected show up as:

Button to secure host, or renew/provision certificate using configured CA plugin;


Error message when VM migration is between secured and unsecured hosts:

How Has This Been Tested?

Tested between a pre-upgraded secured KVM host (el7 based) and post-upgrade it secures libvirtd using same certificates.
Tested tls enabled live vm migration between two secured and unsecured el7 kvm hosts.
