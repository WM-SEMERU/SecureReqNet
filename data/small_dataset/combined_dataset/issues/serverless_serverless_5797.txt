AWS S3 Buckets Lack Encryption and Versioning


This is a Feature Proposal
Description
At a recent security audit I had done on some infrastructure, several of the S3 buckets created by the Serverless Framework showed up as not being encrypted at rest by default, and lacked versioning.
These are default AWS rules in AWS Config and common in security audits, so any buckets created by Serverless Framework show up. There's a serverSideEncryption setting, but it only sets the encryption for uploaded objects, not for all objects, not as a default.
  deploymentBucket:
    serverSideEncryption: AES256
Should the default bucket configuration be this?
{
        Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket',
        Properties: {
          VersioningConfiguration: {
            Status: 'Enabled',
          },
          BucketEncryption: {
            ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration: [
              {
                ServerSideEncryptionByDefault: {
                  SSEAlgorithm: 'AES256',
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      }
