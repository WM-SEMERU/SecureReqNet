Filing this issue over here, to see if we can get some more attention on it. From the original [GitHub](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/issues/5563) issue filed by **alexdiliberto**:

-----

**Summary**: The Merge request "Assign To" dropdown is only populating with members of the "From" repository rather than the "Target" repository.

**Steps to reproduce**: 
1. Fork a repo
2. Code / commit / push to forked repo
3. Create a Merge Request back to the upstream repo
4. Click on the "Assign To" dropdown
5. Notice that the dropdown only contains users from the current forked repo (just myself)
6. Just go ahead and leave it blank and create the Merge Request
7. Now click edit to make changes, then click the "Assign To" dropdown again.
8. Notice now that the dropdown contains users from the target upstream repo which is different from the first time.

**Expected behavior**:
I would expect the dropdown to **always** contain users from the target upstream repo. This is actually what happens when, after I create the merge request, I click Edit and then select the "Assign To" dropdown for a second time.
