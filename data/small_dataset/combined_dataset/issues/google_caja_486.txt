(event || window.event) problematic in inline event-handlers


Original issue 486 created by mikesamuel on 2008-06-11T01:00:51.000Z:
The (window.event || event) idiom is used by inline event handlers to get
access to the current event across browsers.
Firefox interprets inline event handlers with the current boilerplate
(function (event) {
...
}).call(/* target of the current event /, / current event */);
IE puts the event at window.event and has different boilerplate
with (/* target of current event */) {
...
}
Since IE does with, the free names "event" and "window" might be part of
the target node.
Specifically, does "iframe" have a "window" member.
