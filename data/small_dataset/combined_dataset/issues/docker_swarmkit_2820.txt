Always set (empty) UpdateStatus


When deploying a service the UpdateStatus.State field is not present
during docker service create. This complicates creating scripts that
check for UpdateStatus.State to reach a certain state, as they have to take
into account that the UpdateStatus as a whole is missing.
This patch always sets the UpdateStatus.State to make it easier to consume.
