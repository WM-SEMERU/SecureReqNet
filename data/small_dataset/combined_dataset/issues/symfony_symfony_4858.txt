2.1 beta2: Custom success handler throws an exception


I have a custom authentication listener + provider with a custom success handler. when upgrading to 2.1 beta2 (on beta1 everything works good) I get an exception:
RuntimeException: The definition "acme.security.authentication.listener.openid"  has a
reference to an abstract definition "security.authentication.success_handler". Abstract
definitions cannot be the target of references.

I know the error is because of this commit but is it a bug or just wrong implementation by me? It seems that the default abstract handler is passed to the listener instead of my custom one.
my security.yml:
secured_area:
    ...
    openid:
        check_path: /login/openid/auth
        success_handler: acme.identity.authentication.handler
        failure_handler: acme.identity.authentication.handler

and the service definition:
acme.identity.authentication.handler:
    class: %acme.identity.authentication.handler.class%
