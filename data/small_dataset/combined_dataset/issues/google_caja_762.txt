cajita.js has wrong Attribute regexp


Original issue 762 created by ihab.awad on 2008-09-25T00:27:52.000Z:
In cajita.js, we have --
var Attribute = new RegExp(
'^(.*)(?:canRead|canCall|getter|handler)__$');
Mike Stay noticed that the regular expression '.' doesn't match end-of-line
characters, so "x['\n'] = 5" would set a property that does not appear in
getOwnPropertyNames.
Not sure if this is exploitable but should be fixed. Is this fix trivial,
or are there other characters that are not matched by '.'?
