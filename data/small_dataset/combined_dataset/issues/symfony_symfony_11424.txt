simple_form doesn't work with AdvancedUserInterface


How to reproduce:

Create a User class which implements AdvancedUserInterface
Create a custom authenticator
Set up a firewall to use simple_form with the authenticator you just created
Try to login

Google Chrome shows me with error message "Redirect Loop". However, if I change the User class to implement UserInterface, it works.
