Currently ProgressBar flickers when writing a lot.

This patch fixes it and it's buttery smooth now.
Additionally, this improves performance by 60%. Test code
$maxSteps = 1000000;
$progressBar = new ProgressBar(new ConsoleOutput(), $maxSteps);
for ($i=0; $i<= $maxSteps; $i++) {
    $progressBar->advance();
}
