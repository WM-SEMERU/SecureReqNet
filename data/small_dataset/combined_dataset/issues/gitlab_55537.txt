Hi,

**Description:** 
when project owner locks an issue on the project the commenting will be enabled only for project members but if a user commented on an issue before locking it, he can still comment on the issue through the notification email he got simply by replying to it. 

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. create a public project with a public issue
2. from another account comment on that issue and make sure you enabled the notification for that issue before commenting , in your email inbox you will see the comments
3. from the project owner account lock the issue to team members only which from any other account that is not a project member you will see this:

4. go back to the account user in step `2` and reply from your email inbox and you will see that your comment was added although you don't have the permessions to do so!

thanks!
