ISSUE TYPE

Enhancement Request

COMPONENT NAME
API, UI

CLOUDSTACK VERSION
4.12.0

CONFIGURATION
advanced zone with security groups

OS / ENVIRONMENT
Ubuntu/KVM

SUMMARY
We have the requirement that vm needs multiple IPs in different networks.
It is currently not supported by cloudstack

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
While create vm using instance wizard, if multiple shared networks are checked, an error message is displayed: "Can't create a vm with multiple networks one of which is Security Group enabled"
If create a vm with one network, and add vm to other networks. the nics will not work except the first nic.
iptables rules are only applied on first nic
EXPECTED RESULTS
Operations should succeed
iptables/ebtables rules should be applied on all nics
