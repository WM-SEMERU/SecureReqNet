AppArmor loader DaemonSet


This PR adds a proof-of-concept DaemonSet for loading AppArmor profiles from a ConfigMap onto a cluster.
The DaemonSet runs a small go program that is mostly a wrapper around apparmor_parser, which actually loads the profiles. The additional features the loader provides are:

Polling
Sourcing from multiple directories
Better handling of symlinks (necessary for ConfigMap volumes)
Better logging and messaging

This is meant to provide an example of using AppArmor, and be a starting point for users trying out AppArmor or building there own solutions.
