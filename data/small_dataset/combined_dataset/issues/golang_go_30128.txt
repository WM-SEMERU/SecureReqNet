proposal: crypto: add key wrap support for AES key wrap for rfc 3394 and  rfc 5649


What version of Go are you using (go version)?
$ go version
go version go1.11.1 linux/amd64

Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
NO

What did you do?
Symmetric and  Asymmetric keys are need to be exported from a Key Management Solution,  3394 and  rfc 5649 explains a standard for this.
rfc 3394 is for wrapping block length keys and rfc 5649 is an extension for wrapping secret of any length.
I am proposing to add this support in Golang and add key wrap support for AES key wrap for rfc 3394 and  rfc 5649.
What did you expect to see?
Support in Go for  rfc 3394 and  rfc 5649.
What did you see instead?
No support in Go for  rfc 3394 and  rfc 5649.
