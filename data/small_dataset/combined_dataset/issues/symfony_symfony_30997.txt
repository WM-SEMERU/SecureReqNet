Autocompletion is a useful feature, but it's not always possible to anticipate every input the user could provide in advance. For instance, if we're allowing the user to input a path to a file, it's not practical to populate an array with every file and directory in the filesystem, but we can easily build a callback function that populates its suggestions based on the path already inputted.
This change replaces the autocomplete logic that accepts an array of suggestions with an architecture that uses a callback function to populate suggestions in real time as the user provides input.
The first commit adds a test class covering all methods of the Question object, while the second commit modifies the Question object to accept and store a callback function. The existing [gs]etAutocompleterValues() methods are preserved, but instead of being referenced directly from the QuestionHelper, they create and call their own callbacks to emulate the current behaviour.
There is one edge case that is changed, as documented in the test: when a Traversable object is passed to setAutocompleterValues(), the return value of getAutocompleterValues() will be the unpacked (array) form of that object rather than the object itself. The unpacking is done lazily and cached on the callback function.
