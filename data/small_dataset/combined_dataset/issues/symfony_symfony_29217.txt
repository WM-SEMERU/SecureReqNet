Cannot build container if framework.session is set to false


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.0-BETA1
Description
Upgrading to Symfony 4.2.0-BETA1 failed with the following error when framework.session is set to false:
In SecurityExtension.php line 70:

  Warning: array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, boolean given

Looks like it was introduced by #28446 which doesn't handle the false value.
