I don't know if this is currently possible. But it would be nice if the gitlab.rb config file could configure a backup schedule. Further more it would also be nice for it to be able to configure it to upload to S3.

This would automatically create the necessary cron jobs and such.

My understanding was that this is supported through the existing RUBY backup gem.
