Sanity check embeddable mode content invariants on rendered code


Original issue 514 created by mikesamuel on 2008-06-11T21:58:23.000Z:
Our embeddable mode renderer tries to maintain the invariant that nothing
that looks like a tag will appear in rendered text.
Any '<' that appears in code should be followed by a space or be escaped,
modulo <= and << operators.
We could check that our output is 7-bit ascii and has this property by
(1) encoding to 7-bit
(2) translating bytes directly to chars
(4) s/<{2,}/</g
(3) matching on the regexp.  die $& if /</?[^ \r\n=]/
