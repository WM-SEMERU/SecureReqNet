Use RWMutex for accessing plugins


What would you like to be added:
Currently Mutex lock is acquired in plugins.go for accessing different maps.
Some functions only read map entry:
func IsFitPredicateRegistered(name string) bool {
        schedulerFactoryMutex.Lock()
        defer schedulerFactoryMutex.Unlock()
        _, ok := fitPredicateMap[name]

We can utilize RWMutex where the above function acquires read lock.
Why is this needed:
For concurrent calls to IsFitPredicateRegistered / IsPriorityFunctionRegistered, read lock would lower contention.
