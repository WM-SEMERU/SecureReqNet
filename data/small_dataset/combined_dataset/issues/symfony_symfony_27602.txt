Simplify the security config required for login forms


Description
Simplify the security config of a login form.
Example
It's common to use this config when setting up a traditional login form:
security:
    firewalls:
        main:
            # ...
            form_login:
                check_path:  some_route_name
                login_path:  some_route_name
Could we make check_path optional and initialize it to the same value as login_path by default? If some user needs to customize this default value, just define the check_path explicitly as all developers are forced to do now.
