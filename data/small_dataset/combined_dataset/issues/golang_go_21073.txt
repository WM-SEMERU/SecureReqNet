x/tools/cmd/godoc: {tip,beta}.golang.org should redirect to https


http://golang.org redirects to https://golang.org (as do blog, tour, etc., subdomains), but http://beta.golang.org and http://tip.golang.org do not redirect to their https equivalent.
Is this an oversight? Or is it intentional (e.g., because it's needed for testing, or because it's too hard to redirect those domains)?
Unless there's a good reason for it, they should redirect to https. It's inconvenient and uses up people's time having to manually modify URLs to https form when visiting or sharing/pasting URLs.
