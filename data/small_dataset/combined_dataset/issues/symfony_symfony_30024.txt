Note: this only changes the simple error page of Debug component, which is different from the full-featured error page of WebProfilerBundle.

#29891 shows a confusing error page. In #29928 we improved the first error message displayed to the user. In this PR we implement @nicolas-grekas' idea to replace the generic error page title by a better error message. So, this PR + #29928 would fix #29891 to me.
