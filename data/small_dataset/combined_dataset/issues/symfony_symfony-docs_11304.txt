Wrong env file assignment


In setup/symfony_server.rst in the "Docker integration" paragraph there's a typo:
the code should be
DATABASE_URL=${MYSQL_URL}  instead of MYSQL_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
because you're going to override your local DATABASE_URL value with the autogenerated MYSQL_URL variable provided by the symfony cli tool.
