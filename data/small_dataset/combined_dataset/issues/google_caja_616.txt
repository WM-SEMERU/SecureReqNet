Cajoled output for callFuncInlineMethodCall and callFuncInlineMethodApply mentions this


Original issue 616 created by davidsarah.hopwood on 2008-06-14T01:45:58.000Z:
        return substV(
            &quot;(function (@formals*) { @fh*; @stmts*; @body*; })&quot;
            + &quot;.apply(this, @arg);&quot;,

Should be ".apply(t___, @arg);",
and similarly for call.
If the "restricted AST" approach were used, it would be possible to have a
node representing "var t___ = this;", and then assert that no other nodes
mention "this".
Don't know whether this is security-relevant or not, so marking it so
pending review.
