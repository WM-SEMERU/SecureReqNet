Fix scripts/write-emails-to-disk.js


We don't run this very regularly so it's suffered from bit rot. I used it while testing verification reminders and have fixed a few things:

Missing oauthdb argument to createSenders.
Unnecessary usage of legacy_log now that lib/log matches the mozlog interface (ref: #2950).
Config complaining about secrets.

@mozilla/fxa-devs r?
