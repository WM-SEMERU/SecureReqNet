opening local files via DnD creates `about:blank` tabs rather than opening the file


Test plan
See #15204
Description
Opening files via dragging and dropping in the tab bar opens about:blank tabs rather than opening the files. We've also received similar complaints from the community:

I'm assuming this is another regression from the about:blank security issue that we added into the 0.23.104 release which has caused several about:blank regressions.
Steps to Reproduce

ensure that you have a .html or a .txt file saved locally
install & launch either 0.23.206 80a5ac1 or 0.23.107 6f2fc65.
once brave has launched, load any random website in a tab
drop the local file you have saved on top of the above tab and you'll notice that instead of opening the local file, it creates a about:blank tab

Actual result:
macOS Example:

Windows 10 x64 Example:

Expected result:
DnD files into the tab area should be opening the files rather than creating about:blank tabs.
Reproduces how often:
It's 100% reproducible on macOS but not always reproducible on Win.
