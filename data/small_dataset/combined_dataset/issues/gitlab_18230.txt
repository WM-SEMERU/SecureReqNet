'With Subresource Integrity, the browser compares the hash of the asset provided by GitLab with the resource its loaded, preventing malicious assets from being loaded (e.g. if a CDN was compromised). Essentially, it adds an extra hurdle to get over if someone wants to compromise a GitLab instance.

This is [already implemented in sprockets-rails](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails#sri-support), so it should be relatively easy to add.

SRI is currently supported by the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. For Microsoft Edge, the feature has been “Under Consideration” since at least September 2015 and – as of June 2016 – [has yet to have that status updated](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/subresourceintegrity). Unfortunately, [the same is true of WebKit](https://webkit.org/status/#feature-subresource-integrity)
