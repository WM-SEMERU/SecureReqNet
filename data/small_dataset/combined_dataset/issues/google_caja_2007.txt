HTML comments are removed by sanitize


HTML comments of the form are remove by sanitize
var s = '<!-- a test div tag --><div id="one"></div>';
sanitize(s) => '<div id="one"></div>'

How do we allow HTML comments using the sanitize method?
This is causing an issue in my application as it uses IE9's conditional comments
<!--[if IE 9]>
    <p>You are using IE 9</p>
<![endif]-->
