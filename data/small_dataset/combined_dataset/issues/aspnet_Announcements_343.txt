Breaking changes to runtime compilation for Razor views and Razor Pages


As a consequence of cleaning up the ASP.NET Core shared framework to not depend on Roslyn, support for runtime compilation of Razor views and Razor Pages is being moved to a separate package.
Applications that require runtime compilation or re-compilation of Razor files should

Add a reference to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation package
Update the application's ConfigureServices to include a call to AddMvcRazorRuntimeCompilation:

services.AddMvc()
    .AddMvcRazorRuntimeCompilation();
The following APIs previously available on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RazorViewEngineOptions to support runtime compilation would now be available via
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation.MvcRazorRuntimeCompilationOptions:

RazorViewEngineOptions.FileProviders -> MvcRazorRuntimeCompilationOptions.FileProviders
RazorViewEngineOptions.AdditionalCompilationReferences -> MvcRazorRuntimeCompilationOptions.AdditionalReferencePaths

In addition, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RazorViewEngineOptions.AllowRecompilingViewsOnFileChange has been removed. Recompilation on file changes is enabled by default by referencing the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation package.
