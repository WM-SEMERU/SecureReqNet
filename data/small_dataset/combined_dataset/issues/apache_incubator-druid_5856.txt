Immediately send 401 on basic HTTP authentication failure


The filter returned by BasicHTTPAuthenticator did not adhere to this part of the getFilter() method contract in Authenticator:
"If the authentication fails (i.e., a filter recognized the authentication scheme of a request, but the credentials failed to authenticate successfully) the Filter should send an error response, without needing to proceed to other filters in the chain."
This PR adjusts the BasicHTTPAuthenticator to immediately send a 401 in that situation.
