Allow csv query param


Forked from #12507
Updates the server to accept multiple values of a query param in csv form (exec?command=echo,Hi) in addition to the current way of requiring multiple instances of the param (exec?command=echo&command=Hi)
This is because swagger 1.0 has no way of defining a query param that accepts multiple instances. It only supports multiple values in the form of csv using the allowMultiple property(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#524-parameter-object)
Swagger 2.0, however, supports that with collectionFormat using multi:
multi - corresponds to multiple parameter instances instead of multiple values 
for a single instance foo=bar&foo=baz. This is valid only for parameters in 
"query" or "formData"

So we can just wait for go-restful to support 2.0 or accept this PR.
Without a fix, clients generated using swagger spec will not be able to pass multiple command arguments.
