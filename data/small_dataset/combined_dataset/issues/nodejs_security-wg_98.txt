Ecosystem triage severity scale


Now that we are actually assessing and triaging security issues in the ecosystem, we should probably start to think about a methodology to consider the severity of issues.
Possible directions:

perform CIA evaluation of the vuln
take the popularity of the module in account ? (I'm not a big fan of this)
other things?
