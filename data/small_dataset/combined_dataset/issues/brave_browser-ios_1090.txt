Touch ID for BrowserLock


Test plan
1. Ensure touch id is enabled on device
2. Enable browser pin on 1.5 build
3. Background the app
4. Bring app to focus, ensure it asks for touch id to unlock, 
5. Pressing cancel asks for pin to unlock


TouchID Unlock Configuration

If system touch ID is available use this to bypass pin. A 4-digit pin is always required first, and fingerprint can be added as a convenience to unlocking. Since some devices can have issues with fingerprint scanning we need to have a fallback to unlock browser.
