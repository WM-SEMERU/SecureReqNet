Fix template name reference


As written here https://symfony.com/doc/current/templating.html#referencing-templates-in-a-bundle
it seems that {% extends "@!FOSUserBundle/Registration/confirmed.html.twig" %} is not correct.

@AcmeBlog/Blog/index.html.twig: This syntax is used to specify a template for a specific page. The three parts of the string, each
separated by a slash (/), mean the following:
@AcmeBlog: is the bundle name without the Bundle suffix. This template lives in the AcmeBlogBundle (e.g. src/Acme/BlogBundle);
