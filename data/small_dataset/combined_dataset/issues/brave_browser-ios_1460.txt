Update to HTTPS Everywhere 6.0


HTTPS Everywhere  6.0 has been deployed to S3! It adds a lot of new rules.
There is some chance this release will break things (since there was a ruleset format change), so I recommend testing it before bumping the prod version to 6.0.
Here it is:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/https-everywhere-data/6.0/httpse.leveldb.tgz
https://s3.amazonaws.com/https-everywhere-data/6.0/httpse.leveldb.zip
test plan:
Go to http://www.haproxy.org/. It should be upgraded to HTTPS
Go to http://www.thompsonhotels.com/. Images should appear on the site.
Go to https://https-everywhere.badssl.com/. Under shields, it should show 1 HTTPS upgrade.
