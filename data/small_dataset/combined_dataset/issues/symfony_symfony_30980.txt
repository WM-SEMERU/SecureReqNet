Related to #30818
This is an example of some property list extractor implementations, things that need to be done to complete this PR:

 Add a way to update context: maybe an new interface ?, this is needed for nested attributes behaviour, and will also be need for the instantiator part
 Add groups behaviour implementation
 Add max depth implementation
