Static cajoler rewrites "name" attribute, html sanitizer does not


Original issue 600 created by collin.jackson on 2008-06-13T17:26:42.000Z:
When an element is created with innerHTML, its name property is not
rewritten the way that the it is when the static cajoler is used.
Example:
<div id="foo"></div>
<script>
document.getElementById("foo").innerHTML = "<form name='body'></form>";
</script>
What is the expected output?
The form's name is suffixed with the module ID.
What do you see instead?
document.body is overwritten.
