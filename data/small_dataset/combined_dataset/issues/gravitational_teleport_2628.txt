Trim whitespace in SAML metadata decoding.


Description
Some identity providers add additional whitespace in the ds:X509Certificate entity. For example:
<ds:X509Certificate>
    [...]
</ds:X509Certificate>

Instead of the following:
<ds:X509Certificate>[...]</ds:X509Certificate>

This PR fixes this issue by removing whitespace before attempting to base64 decode the certificate.
