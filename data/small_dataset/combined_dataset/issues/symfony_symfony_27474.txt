[Guard] [3.4] Implementing the AuthenticatorInterface still throws a deprecation message


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4
Description
Implementing the AuthenticatorInterface instead of extending AbstractGuardAuthenticator still throws deprecated message
I wrote a class FormAuthenticator that extended the Guard AbstractGuardAuthenticator. After upgrading from 3.3 to 3.4 (as an LTS version), I ran Psalm, which told me that this class was deprecated. It tells me to not extend from Guard AbstractGuardAuthenticator, but instead to implement Guard AuthenticatorInterface. However, the AuthenticatorInterface extends from the GuardAuthenticatorInterface, which is also deprecated.
How to reproduce
Try to implement a Guard implementing the recommended Interface for Symfony 3.4, by using 


symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Guard/AuthenticatorInterface.php


         Line 26
      in
      143bdfc






 interface AuthenticatorInterface extends GuardAuthenticatorInterface 





Possible Solution
Duplicate the code from the Interface, instead of extending the replacement from the deprecated interface.
