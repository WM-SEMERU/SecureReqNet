Without this fix we're getting warnings like
PHP Notice:  Undefined index: %5BOUR-KEY%5D%5B1%5D in vendor/symfony/cache/Traits/PhpFilesTrait.php on line 136

when doing a $cache->contains() in some cases. I'm having a lot of trouble tracking down exactly when and where this error will happen and what changes in our app / cache cause it, but this fix seems benign enough that maybe it can be merged without that backstory.
