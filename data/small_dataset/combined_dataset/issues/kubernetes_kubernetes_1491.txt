Determine how namespaces and labels and access control interact.


Simple approach:

Selectors can only refer to labels in one namespace
the namespace is the one of the object that the selectors is attached to.
if a replicationController wants to add a label to a pod, for example, then how does it avoid colliding with other labels

put labels on the template (how to support replicationController-provided values)
reserve certain label keys (e.g. replController-opaqueInstanceId=xe4h1)


only access control is "can I see this namespace", which allows or denies seeing the object, their labels, and doing selectors on them.

Complex approach:

Selectors can refer to labels in other namespaces
define format like `/=
need access controls to prevent someone from setting labels that would cause their pods to join services they shouldn't be in.
need access controls to prevent users from determining the existence of labels they should not be able to see.

Recommendation:

Keep is simple for now.  Can always prepend namespace and add access controls later.
