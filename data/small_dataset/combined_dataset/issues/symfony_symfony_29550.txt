TraceableVoter seems to retain tags from inner service


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.0
Description
I have a voter that implements ServiceSubscriberInterface. When clearing the cache I get the following error:
[Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Exception\InvalidArgumentException]                                                                                         
  Service "debug.security.voter.App\Voter\MyVoter" must implement interface "Symfony\Contracts\Service\ServiceSubscriberInterface".

How to reproduce
Create a auto-configured voter that implements ServiceSubscriberInterface and clear the cache in dev.
Possible Solution
Not a solution but if I remove this bit of code from AddSecurityVoter, it works as expected.
Additional context
Possibly related to #29385?
Looks to have been introduced in #27914.
