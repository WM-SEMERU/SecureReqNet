Unclean exception handling in PasswordEncoderInterface::encodePassword()


Symfony version(s) affected: 2.4+
Description
PasswordEncoderInterface::encodePassword() doesn't declare any exceptions, yet implementations do throw some.
All built-in implementations throw BadCredentialsException if the password is excessively long.
Some implementations also throw LogicExceptions, e.g. Argon2iPasswordEncoder throws it if Argon2i isn't available).
PlaintextPasswordEncoder also throws an InvalidArgumentException if the passed salt contains invalid characters.
Possible Solution
The interface should declare all exceptions implementations are allowed to throw. I think it's safe to say that BadCredentialsException should be added.
Not sure about the others, though. Maybe ignore the fact that LogicExceptions are thrown (if we are quite sure that these exceptions only occur at dev time) and throw BadCredentialsException instead of InvalidArgumentException?
