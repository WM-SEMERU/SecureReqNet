[filter box] Loading icon shown when nothing is being loaded


Repro:
(1) Switch to viz type that requires additional left hand nav fields to be populated
(2) While validation check has errored (due to no fields being populated), Superset infinity loading icon is "spinning", indicating something is loading, but in reality, nothing is
Users are trained to "wait" until the loading stops when they should be correcting the validation error.
Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!

 I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
 I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset. (deck.gl, filter box, time series table, etc.)
 I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.
