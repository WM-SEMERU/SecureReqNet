Re-opening #20272 in the same spirit of #22572, and i have no better solution to enable route matching :)
Not sure about the config yet, it differs from the logout listener where both configs (path + request_matcher) must match.
So for access control to get the same behavior (where all configs must match) it needs a chain request matcher or get creative with AccessMap::add.
Otherwise i think the logout listener should follow this behavior.
