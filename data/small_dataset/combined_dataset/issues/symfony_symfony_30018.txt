FormTypeInterface wrong doc-block on method getBlockPrefix


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4 and later.
Description
Based on the doc-block getBlockPrefix method of FormTypeInterface returns string. On the AbstractType on the other hand, the result of StringUtil::fqcnToBlockPrefix can also return null. We should change the interface doc-block to return null as well.
