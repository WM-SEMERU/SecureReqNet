Stateless Authentication which relies on only Bearer token?


Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!

 I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
 I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
 I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.

Currently, Superset uses session-based authentication where the cookie is sent with each request. Can we have stateless authentication i.e the backend will not store any session and will rely on access-token sent in Header by the client? eg. Header: Authorization: Bearer eerkjerkcwk.....
