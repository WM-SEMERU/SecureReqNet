Polish Rewards settings panels


The Rewards panels in setting needs a little bit of alignment and simplification work. A few areas of note would be:

The list item bullet style in the disabled panels should be removed.
The typography variations can be simplified a bit. Especially the body copy. Should probably be made a little darker, bigger and given more space between lines.
The amount of colors is making it a little hard to know what to concentrate on. This could be simplified down a bit.
General alignment, justification and spacing consistency. In particular in the setting panels where we are setting an explicit max width and centering the content.
Should probably put the Brave Rewards title container in a white box with a drop shadow to match the other elements so it doesn't take on a disabled feeling being on the grey background. Could argue a change like that might resolve: #3238

This is all a stepping stone to eventual design system rules and also making the page able to be responsively resized.
Before and afters are below.
