'Example:
- Developer with AD username "dev-user" has email "dev-user@company.com" and has profile in GitLab Server.
- AD User administrator create in AD user "test-user" with some password and set mail attribute to "dev-user@company.com"

Result: 
AD User administartor can use login "test-user" for full access to developer account "dev-user"

Suggest:
During GitLab Login lookup profile use both e-mail and username!!!
