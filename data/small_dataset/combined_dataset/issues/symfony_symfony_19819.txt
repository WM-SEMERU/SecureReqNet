This allows to retrieve the RememberMeServices service of the current firewall using:
FirwallMap::getRememberMeServices(Request $request) : RememberMeServicesInterface
An alternative could be to create a public alias of the service.
It seems there are use cases, see the ticket and the ones mentioning it (some from FOSUserBundle).
