This patch will use the current stored context found in a token (provided, there is one), if none has been specified.
According to a quick scan of the code, this will be the only place where getProviderKey() is used outside a specific class (the authentication providers will check token type before calling getProviderKey(), but maybe it's be a good idea to implement a "providerKeyTokenInterface" or something. It's a nicer solution imho than the current method_exists()
