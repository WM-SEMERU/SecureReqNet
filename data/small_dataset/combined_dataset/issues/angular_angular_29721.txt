@bazel/bazel always warn that the binary is global


üêû bug report
Affected Package
@bazel/bazel
Is this a regression?
Not sure
Description
When using @bazel/bazel togather with @angular/bazel a warning is being displayed even when the resolved binary is local
  *** WARNING
    The Bazel binary is being run from a global install.
    
    This means the version may not match the one used in your project.
    We recommend installing the @bazel/bazel package locally in your project.
  ***

However, taking a look at the binary path it is being resolved to the local one
C:\git\cli-repos\my-proj\node_modules\@bazel\bazel\node_modules\@bazel\bazel-win32_x64\package.json

üî¨ Minimal Reproduction
ng new my-proj
cd my-proj
ng add @angular/bazel 
ng build
