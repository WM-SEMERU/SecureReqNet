When you click the "Dangerous settings" button, then click "Remove Project", your project doesn't get completely removed. It sticks around on the file system, meaning the user can't re-create a project with the same name.

GitLab provides a tool to garage collect old projects, but it doesn't seem to actually remove anything for me.

The project should be removed from the file system immediately upon hitting the button. If there is concern about accidental removals or backups - some ideas that come to mind are renaming, moving to a separate deleted repositories path, or moving to /tmp. With the current functionality, you can't re-create projects without contacting an administrator.
