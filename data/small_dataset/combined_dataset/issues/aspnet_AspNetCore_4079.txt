Question: CookieAuthenticationOptions.SlidingExpiration


Describe the bug
We are using IdentityServer4, and We have set the cookie life span to 30 minutes and also we enabled (set to true) CookieAuthenticationOptions.SlidingExpiration option.
If there is an user interaction with the web application, we renew the access token life time and it supposed to keep sliding for another 30 more minutes from that renewal time and this is happening. Along with access token renewal, it is supposed to extend the session cookie life time also. But I just came to know that, to issue a new cookie with a new expiration time, the renewal request needs to happen only when the existing cookie life time is more than halfway through the expiration window.
Is there a way to override this behavior, every time I issue a cookie, it should issue a new cookie with new time irrespective of whether the cookie life time is more than halfway or not.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Using this version of ASP.NET Core '2.1'

Expected behavior
cookie always needs to keep sliding from the point of issuance.
