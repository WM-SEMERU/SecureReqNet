this PR provides two things:

It is possible now to user username and password in a failover or round robin transport when using smtp
Fixed a type problem with username and password for the smtp transport as getUsername() cannot return null because of its signature but if no username is provided then the property would have been null. Fixed with setting an empty string as default. Same for password. (This was discovered by adding a test - yeah!)
