[RFC][Monolog] Consider adding a hard limit on log buffered in dev


Description
When running consumer / worker in dev env, they leaks a lot. Symfony buffer all logs (mainly for the profiler). In CLI I'm not sure it makes sens.
So IMHO we could disable this feature in CLI or at least add an hard limit.
WDYT ?
