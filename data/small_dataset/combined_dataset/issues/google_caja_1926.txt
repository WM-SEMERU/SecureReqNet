Host can't see Function.prototype.length of guest functions.


Original issue 1928 created by max99x on 2014-08-01T18:23:49.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
v5678, Chrome 36, Linux, SES mode
What steps will reproduce the problem?

In the host define an API method f = function(g) {alert(g.length);}
In the client, define function h = function(a, b) {}
In the client, call f(h).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect "2" to be displayed, as that is the number of arguments declared by the client function, and it's what happens if you perform a similar call purely in the host. In reality, "1" gets displayed, since when the client function is passed through Caja, it gets wrapped in a function that declares a single unused parameter and forwards all arguments using the "arguments" object to the wrapped function.
Please provide any additional information below.
