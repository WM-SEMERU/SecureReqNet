## Background

Summary of GitLab rate limits here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41308#note_87693185

I think we added the limit in question because git auth requests are expensive, so it helps to reduce load from very basic attacks and accidentally bad auth requests due to misconfiguration.

## Proposal

I suggest we bump up the limit from 30 req/3 mins to say, 100 req/5 minutes.

We could modify GitLab defaults or just customize GitLab.com.

## Rationale

Relaxing the limit could really help legitimate users running into https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support-forum/issues/3274 because the problem is rare and intermittent (when it's not due to obviously broken configuration), which could mean these users barely hit the limit.

It would also be helpful to reduce the ban from 1 hour since the IP ban also blocks already-authenticated requests (like navigating GitLab.com) which is really harsh on legitimate users. Maybe 30 minutes would be sufficient?

## Risk

* Potential increase in load from unintentional and intentional failed git/JWT auth requests. How much?
* More risk from brute force attacks. How much?

My feeling based on no hard evidence is that the risks are acceptable, but I'm probably not the right person to say so.
