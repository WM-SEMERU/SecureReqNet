Application option to only try exact found commands, not similars


I don't like Application 'smart-finding' a command that's similar to what I typed, and executing it without any notification, even though that's not what I typed. Currently that behavior is hard-coded in Application::find(). I would love an option to disable that behavior. A public method, or a protected property (to disable in a child application class).
With that option enabled (or the smart-find disabled, whichever way you want to name it) it would just throw an error. Something like:

Command "%s" not found.\nDid you mean "%s"?

And then the user can choose what to do.
I would make a PR, but all class properties are private, and I would make a protected $enableSmartFind = true; (which is probably not allowed), so any subclass can disable it.

It'd also be lovely to use some of that private info in a child class. A child class can't even do:
$allCommands = $this->commandLoader ? array_merge($this->commandLoader->getNames(), array_keys($this->commands)) : array_keys($this->commands);

(like in find()) to find all registered commands. Why so private..?
