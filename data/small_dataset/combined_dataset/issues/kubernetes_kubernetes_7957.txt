Verify apiserver certificate on kube-up


At the moment, kube-up will call curl --insecure to check if the master is reachable, e.g. in cluster/gce/util.sh:597:
until curl --insecure -H "Authorization: Bearer ${KUBE_BEARER_TOKEN}" \
This will leak the bearer token to any man-in-the-middle attacker.
