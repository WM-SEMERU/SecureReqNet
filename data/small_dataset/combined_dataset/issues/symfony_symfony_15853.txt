2.8 Web Debug Toolbar Error with no logout firewall key


When using the new 2.8 web debug toolbar, the Collector/security.html.twig template uses the logout_path() Twig function to print the logout key. But, if you don't have a logout key configured, this will fail with something like:

An exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template
("No LogoutListener found for firewall key "main".") in @Security/Collector/security.html.twig
at line 39.

I don't know if we can detect whether there is a logout listener in the firewall or not, so we may need to remove this link.
