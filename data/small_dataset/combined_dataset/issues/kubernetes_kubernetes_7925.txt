Security contexts and volumes


Now that #7343 is in, we can begin discussing the relationship between SecurityContexts and Volumes.  There are a couple different facets:

Volumes should be validated against their assigned security contexts.  For example, it should be a validation error if a pod which is not allowed to access the host's filesystem contains a hostDir volume.
Files in volumes should have the SELinux context set based on the security context of the pod.  For example, if you create a pod with a secret volume, and the pod's security context contains an SELinux context, then the tmpfs mount for the secret volume's rootcontext should come from the pod's SELinux context.
Files in volumes should belong to the uid in their security context.
