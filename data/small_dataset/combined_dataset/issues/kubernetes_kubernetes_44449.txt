Switch to pointer to policy rule, visit and short circuit during authorization


Ref #40015

Switches policy rule helper methods to work with pointers
Switches authorization to use a short-circuiting visitor

Best-case, authorization short-circuits early and avoids accumulating rules it never needs to check
Worst-case (a forbidden request), it still checks all the applicable rules, but requires less allocation to do so
