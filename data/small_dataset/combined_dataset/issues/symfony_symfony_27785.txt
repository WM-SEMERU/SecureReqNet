No referer to redirect back in Event Subscriber for url with method POST


Description
I was trying to create my own kind a middleware to verify CSRF token using event subscriber for onKernelRequest request. I noticed that, in that event we have no referer to redirect user back when he submits POST form.
Example
UserController.php on line 110:
Request {#18 ▼
  +headers: HeaderBag {#25 ▼
    #headers: array:13 [▼
      "cookie" => array:1 [▶]
      "accept-language" => array:1 [▶]
      "accept-encoding" => array:1 [▶]
      "referer" => array:1 [▶]

in subscriber
  +headers: HeaderBag {#25 ▼
    #headers: array:12 [▼
      "cookie" => array:1 [▶]
      "accept-language" => array:1 [▶]
      "accept-encoding" => array:1 [▶]
      "dnt" => array:1 [▶]
      "accept" => array:1 [▶]
      "user-agent" => array:1 [▶]

no referer for that event.
Tried
  KernelEvents::FINISH_REQUEST  => [  // or ::REQUEST
                ['onKernelRequest', 0],
            ],

no header or server referer, do not know yet how to redirect user back from POST url to GET url with form.
