Description:
Browser crash after sync
Devices

Device 1: iPhone 7+ (iOS 12) Sync chain created on this device
Device 2: iPhone 6+ (iOS 12) Crashing device

Steps to Reproduce
Scenario 1

Create bookmarks on device1 before enabling Sync chain
Add device 2 to sync chain via QR code scan
Edit bookmarks on device 1, just reordering is enough
On device 2, load one of the bookmarks which was reordered in device 1
Wait for few seconds, browser crash on device 2

Scenario 2

Create bookmarks on device1 before enabling Sync chain
Add device 2 to sync chain via QR code scan
Edit bookmarks on device 1, just reordering is enough
Keep device 1 on  edit mode for a few mins (not sure if this makes any difference)
On device 2 on the same tab load bookmarks that are sync'd (hope that doesn't crash like in scenario 1)
Open bookmark manager in device 2 and keep the app in that state for a few mins, try tapping on tab to close bookmark manager, browser crashes on device 2

Actual result:
Browser crash after sync
Expected result:
Should not crash
Reproduces how often: [Easily reproduced/Intermittent issue]
Found scenario 2 while retesting for scenario 1 so should be fairly easy
