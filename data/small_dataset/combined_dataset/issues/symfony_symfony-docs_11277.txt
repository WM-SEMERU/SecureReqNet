ordered use statements in code examples


I know, that this could lead to massive merge conflicts, but if we would not merge it up, I could create a shiny new PullRequest against 4.2 and I am willing to merge it up and fix the conflicts, too!
Or does any thoughts about not to order the use statements exist, which I doesn't know?
There are a lot more todo, but before finishing this PR, I'd like to receive some feedback
