Enforce multiple Authentication Schemes


When set up with multiple authentication schemes I can do the following to run them both:
[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "Scheme1,Scheme2")]
This runs both schemes and if at least one succeeds the execution proceeds into the controller action.
I'd like to be able to set this up so that it runs both schemes and makes them both required. I. e. the one that fails issues a challenge.
When both schemes are present the framework correctly merges the ClaimIdentities into User ClaimsPrincipal.
Apologies if this is already possible and I missed it.
