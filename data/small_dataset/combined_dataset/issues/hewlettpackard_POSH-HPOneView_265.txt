Add a filter function to "Get-HPOVAuditLog"


Please fill in as much information as possible to help resolve your issue.
Can a filter function be added to "Get-HPOVAuditLog" ?
The current setup gives me the complete audit dump. This is slow and impacts the appliance.
We would like to add a filter option to only retrieve for example all events of the last 2 hours.
This works for the Rest API
Retrieval and scan on recent audits events is required for us, and would be nice to do this completely in powershell. As Oneview lacks a syslog option, this is a workaround to do this.
