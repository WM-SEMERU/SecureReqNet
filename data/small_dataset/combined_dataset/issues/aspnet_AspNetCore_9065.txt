MissingManifestResourceException forces you to Stop running.


Describe the bug
I get a lot of these exceptions:
System.Resources.MissingManifestResourceException: 'Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture.  Make sure "Foo.Bar.Resources.Areas.Identity.Pages.Account.Manage.IndexModel+InputModel.resources" was correctly embedded or linked into assembly "Foo.Bar" at compile time, or that all the satellite assemblies required are loadable and fully signed.'

sometimes I can just F5 them and continue,
Other times I just get this and I can only click Stop and run my solution again:
