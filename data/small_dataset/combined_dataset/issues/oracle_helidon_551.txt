Support for named routing in Health, Metrics etc.


We should support named routings in MP extensions such as Metrics and Healthchecks
In case a named socket is configured, we should provide the possibility to assign MP extensions to run on such a socket
Example config:
metrics:
  socket: "admin"
health:
  socket: "admin"

server:
  sockets...

If the "admin" socket is configured, both metrics and health would be exposed only on that socket using the named routing feature.
