Requirements for third party access to submission system


Do we want to allow third parties to log into the submission system on behalf of a financial institution? Some thoughts on requirements that we should consider for allowing third-party access and rights.
Third parties may want to partake in the following activities:

upload data and run edits to check a submission on behalf of a financial institution
audit submission data and edit responses on behalf of a financial institution
prepare a submission on behalf of an institution (i.e. upload file, run edits, respond to edits)

If a third party has access to the system, how will this third party obtain access? Some considerations:

financial institution must grant permission to third party
access granted manually through HMDA Help or frontend portal
access granted automatically through email domain with proper two factor authentication
