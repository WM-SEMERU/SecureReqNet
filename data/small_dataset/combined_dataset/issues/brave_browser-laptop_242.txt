Browser fingerprint is unique


I know it's early, but this might be a good time to think about uniqueness of browser fingerprint.  I ran brave through http://panopticlick.eff.org and it came up very unique.  The user agent was most identifying.  It would be really cool if we could reduce the entropy here.
Raw copy/paste from the web site (sorry it is not tabular):
