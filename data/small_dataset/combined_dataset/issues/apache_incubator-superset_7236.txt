Error in SQL editor with slashes in schema name


Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!

 I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
 I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
 I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.

When using Superset with a PrestoDB database to connect Apache Pulsar SQL worker, errors are occurring when working with a schema containing slashes.
I am able to query data corectly but the UI is broken.
Sample query: select * from pulsar."public/default".generator_test limit 10;
Superset version
I am using Superset version 0.28.1 in Kubernetes using helm.
Expected results
I should be able to list tables from a schema containing slashes.
Actual results
An AJAX request is made to /superset/tables/2/public/default/undefined/ and finishes with status 404.
The UI displays an error message: Error while fetching table list
Steps to reproduce

Create a database with slashes in schema names (using pulsar for instance)
Add this database to Superset
Go to SQL editor and select a schema containing slashes in the select box
