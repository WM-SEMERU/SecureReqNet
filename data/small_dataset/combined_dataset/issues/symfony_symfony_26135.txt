Hello,
Here is a proposal to improve DX for the login form :

Template file would use the form function

No need to bother with action, input name, translator


Controller only requires to create a form

No need to call the AuthenticationUtils anymore


CSRF is rendered with the FormType

No need to take care of this in the template



I have a concrete (working) example with symfony-demo here.
This PR is a POC/draft at the moment to concretely show what I would like to do. If the idea is accepted I will update the PR.
Let me know what you all think. Perhaps it is a terrible idea for some reasons :D
Note 1 : At the same time we could also add more information in the "Security Firewall" section of the profiler.
Note 2 : If someone have an idea to make the LoginType secure by default when the CSRF is loaded it would be amazing.
Note 3 : I took some ideas from \Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Tests\Functional\Bundle\CsrfFormLoginBundle\Form\UserLoginType
