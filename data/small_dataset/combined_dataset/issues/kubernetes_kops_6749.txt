Kops 1.10 can not set etcd provider for etcd-manager, getting unhandled field


1. What kops version are you running? The command kops version, will display
this information.
Version 1.10.1 (git-a67edea6d)
2. What Kubernetes version are you running? kubectl version will print the
version if a cluster is running or provide the Kubernetes version specified as
a kops flag.
1.10.10
3. What cloud provider are you using?
aws
4. What commands did you run?  What is the simplest way to reproduce this issue?
Following https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/etcd/manager.md I get the error below:
$ export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=SpecOverrideFlag
$ kops set cluster cluster.spec.etcdClusters[*].provider=Manager
Using cluster from kubectl context: blabla

unhandled field: "cluster.spec.etcdClusters[*].provider=Manager"

5. What happened after the commands executed?
6. What did you expect to happen?
The setting provider: Manager to get added to the etcd yaml
7. Please provide your cluster manifest. Execute
kops get --name my.example.com -o yaml to display your cluster manifest.
You may want to remove your cluster name and other sensitive information.
8. Please run the commands with most verbose logging by adding the -v 10 flag.
Paste the logs into this report, or in a gist and provide the gist link here.
$ kops -v 10 set cluster cluster.spec.etcdClusters[*].provider=Manager --name=cluster

9. Anything else do we need to know?
In case this should work with newer kops and/or k8s versions please update the etcd-manager page accordingly.
