Hi
We've just upgraded to v7.1.0 and can no longer create Internal repos.
As an Admin user, and as an Owner of the group I'm trying to create the repo for, if I enter a name for the repo and then click the "Internal" radio button, and then click "Create Project" button, I get the error message at the top of the page:  "Visibility level is reserved".

This was working before the v7.1.0 upgrade.

The section in the gitlab.yml file that allows you to restrict the visibility level looks as below (we haven't altered anything in the config file).  Our set up is so that non-admin users can only create Private repos, but as mentioned, I'm an Admin user.

#Restrict setting visibility levels for non-admin users.
    # The default is to allow all levels.
    restricted_visibility_levels: [ "public", "internal" ]

Any help would be much appreciated!

Regards
Chris
