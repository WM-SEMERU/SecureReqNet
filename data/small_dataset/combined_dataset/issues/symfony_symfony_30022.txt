[Security] AuthenticationException logged as info


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4+
Description
In UsernamePasswordJsonAuthenticationListener if there is an AuthenticationException, it is logged as info instead of error. See here I assume error should be the right level to be used here.
How to reproduce
Try to throw an exception somewhere during \Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authentication\AuthenticationManagerInterface::authenticate process. The easiest might be is not to have proper settings to your db layer, a db related exception should be thrown.
Possible Solution
Let's log this exception as an error.
