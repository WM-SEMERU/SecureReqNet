kube-proxy running in ipvs mode causes cilium cni failure


What happened:
When running with cilium cni together with kube-proxy in ipvs mode
atfer running some time cilium pods crash with
level=warning msg="++ ip -4 addr show to 10.233.74.1" subsys=daemon
level=warning msg="Error: Buffer too small for object." subsys=daemon

Issuing
ip -4 addr show
on any node returns same result.
What you expected to happen:
I expect for cilium pods to be able to read ip -4 addr without problems
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Install cilium with default settings, use kube-proxy in ipvs mode. Add some services and wait for a while. When ip -4 show addr starts to fail, try to delete cilium pods. They won't be able to start.
Anything else we need to know?:
Flushing interfaces works for a while, but in long term problem persists
