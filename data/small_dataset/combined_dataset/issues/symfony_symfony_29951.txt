Error in PostAuthenticationGuardToken::serialize because of bug in PHP 7.3


Symfony version(s) affected: 2.8.0-4.2.2 (ONLY with PHP 7.3+)
Description
A bug in PHP7.3 (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77302) which was also discussed in #29459 creates an issue where an object (sometimes?) cannot be serialized twice.
This is what happens in PostAuthenticationGuardToken::serialize / PostAuthenticationGuardToken::unserialize:
    public function serialize()
    {
        $serialized = serialize(array($this->providerKey, parent::serialize()));

        return $serialized;
    }

    public function unserialize($serialized)
    {
        list($this->providerKey, $parentStr) = unserialize($serialized);

        parent::unserialize($parentStr);
    }

Which results in an error Notice: unserialize(): Error at offset x of y bytes when using symfony guard.
How to reproduce
See https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77302
Possible solution
I don't know how to fix this without a BC break. Since it's basically a PHP bug only affecting some users I also don't know how to proceed.
