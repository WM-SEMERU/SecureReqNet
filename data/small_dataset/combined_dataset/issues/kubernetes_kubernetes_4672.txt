Key/Cert rotation for Kubernetes clients.


We may want to rotate keys/certs periodically for things that use pkg/client.

we might rotate the master's certs when they expire.  don't want clients to fail during that transitition
Pod using automatically generated credentials in a secrets volume.
kubelet/kube-proxy using a per-node token or x509 keypair

Suggest we assume that whatever key rotation plan is used (out of scope of this bug), that old and new tokens/keypairs will always have overlapping lifetimes.  If not, we'd need to teach .kubeconfig to have a list of creds and teach pkg/client to retry.  (I prefer the former option).
Suggest pkg/client watches the .kubeconfig file and any file mentioned by it, using inotify.
