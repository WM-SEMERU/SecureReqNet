Add ca-certificates.crt to the control plane images


Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (choose one):
FEATURE REQUEST
Kubernetes version (use kubectl version): HEAD
Currently, ca-certificates isn't included in the kube-(apiserver|controller-manager|scheduler) images.
However, ca-certificates are often used in production scenarios (for example on AWS and GCE where the controller-manager/apiserver might contact other servers via HTTPS)
The "solution" to this problem has been to host-mount /etc/ssl/certs to the container, but this is sub-optimal.
I propose to include ca-certificates.crt in the server images as the default. Most scenarios won't be affected as it's overridden by the hostPath mount. It will help in the scenarios where there isn't such a mount.
While writing this, I can't come up with a scenario where adding ca-certificates will break the deployment.
Instead, it will make installing kubernetes easier (and remove the need for unnecessary host-mounts)

I can make a quick PR for this for inclusion in v1.7 if you like.
