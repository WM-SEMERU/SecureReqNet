Brave browser won't run in sandbox mode on Debian 9 Stretch


Description
If I try running Brave without the sandbox mode, I get the following error:
No usable sandbox! Update your kernel or see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux_suid_sandbox_development.md for more information on developing with the SUID sandbox. If you want to live dangerously and need an immediate workaround, you can try using --no-sandbox.
Brave does indeed work with --no-sandbox mode albeit with a much less safe security mode. Also updating the kernel doesn't solve the problem.
Steps to Reproduce

Open up Konsole
Type "Brave"
That's it

Actual result:
No usable sandbox! Update your kernel or see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux_suid_sandbox_development.md for more information on developing with the SUID sandbox. If you want to live dangerously and need an immediate workaround, you can try using --no-sandbox.
Expected result:
Actually being about to use this web browser
