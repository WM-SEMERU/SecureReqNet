While testing disabling a user, I decided to try to impersonate the disabled user and found that you are able to impersonate the user as normal (as if they were never disabled). I expected the user should be disabled. Is this expected behavior?
When I log out, then try to log in as the disabled user, I am properly alerted that the account is disabled and am not logged in.
