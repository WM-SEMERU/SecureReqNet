**Summary**

When pushing from a repository satellite back to the bare repo, it fails with the error:

> GitLab: You are not allowed to access master!

That also causes the web editor to fail with the error "Your changes could not be committed". Pushing from SSH works fine.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Go to a repo satellite (on the server).
2. Run `sudo -u git git push`.

**Expected behavior**

Pushing should work completely fine.

**Observed behavior**

Pushing fails with the following output:

```
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 1.56 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: GitLab: You are not allowed to access master!
remote: error: hook declined to update refs/heads/master
To /home/git/repositories/leo/itframe.git
 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to '/home/git/repositories/leo/itframe.git'
```

**Investigation**

After digging through GitLab's code, I found out that the API call that determines if you're allowed to push is (always) returning `false`.

Here's the URL being called: https://example.com/api/v3/internal/allowed?action=git-receive-pack&ref=master&project=leo%2Fitframe&forced_push=false&oldrev=aabbcc&newrev=0123456

You can notice that the parameter `user_id` or `key_id` is missing from the URL.

It should be: https://example.com/api/v3/internal/allowed?user_id=1&action=git-receive-pack&ref=master&project=leo%2Fitframe&forced_push=false&oldrev=aabbcc&newrev=0123456

That is causing the `@actor` variable in the gitlab-shell hook to be `nil`. As it hasn't been passed to the API, that in turn results in always getting `false`.

**Checks**

Everything is normal; all tests are passing.

**Workaround**

Only run the permission check if we're over SSH. This allows the web editor to work, **but removes the permission check**.
