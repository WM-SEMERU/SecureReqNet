recompiles with ctrl c


üêû Bug report
- [X ] serve

Is this a regression?
No, i am new to angular-cli
Description
when running ng-serve it takes time but it complies, but when saving when the angular-cli should recompile sometime he does, and sometimes it needs me to do ctrl c for it to continue with the re-complie.
Has anyone experienced something like this?
üî¨ Minimal Reproduction
first run ng-serve, and then make a change to a file,
now when you look at the cli you can sometime see nothing happen so you do CTRL+C and then it continues with the compile and its all ok,
Or
it gets stuck somewhere in the middle of compile for a long time and you do a CTRL+C and then it continues to work.
