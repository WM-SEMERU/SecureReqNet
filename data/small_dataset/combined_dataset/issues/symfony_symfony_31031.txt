When this class was introduced, there was an assumption made about the type of propertyNames and therefore a : ?string return type was introduced in the fallbacks/normalization private methods. Because symfony doesn't use strict mode yet (compatibility issues with php IIRC), when using a non-string property name (for example the integer 0 which is a valid property name in an array), it will convert the integer to a string.
This is not good, especially if you have a name converter that returns the given property name (ie no transformation) you'll have it's type changed which isn't correct.
I've discovered this bug while working on adding this name converter in api platform (api-platform/core#2709).
