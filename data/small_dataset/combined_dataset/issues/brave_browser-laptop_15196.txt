Hangs up on login


I am using brave on linux (Ubuntu 16.10)
I have noticed that the sites which require the login using facebook/google/other_accounts usually opens a pop up window for login to facebook/google/other_accounts. The problem is that the pop-window hangs after putting in the credentials.
Any quick hack to resolve this?
Here are some screenshots
Soundcloud site

After clicking the sign-in

After selecting google and selecting the account, this window hangs

This is just one example, it happens almost on every such site.
