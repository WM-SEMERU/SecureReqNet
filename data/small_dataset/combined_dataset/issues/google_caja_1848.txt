form input doesn't show correctly in IE 10


Original issue 1850 created by hidden.puddle on 2013-09-03T03:37:43.000Z:
In IE 10, the "Add" button doesn't show as a "submit" button but as text input.
In my own app, I have radio buttons and those also appear as text inputs.
It seems to me that HTMLService doesn't fully work on IE10.
