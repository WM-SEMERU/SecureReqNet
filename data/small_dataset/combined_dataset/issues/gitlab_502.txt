Changed email address via profile, and got validation link.  Clicked link, all was changed.

All notifications are still going to old email address, even though profile and admin console show new email address.

Tried to restart gitlab, and server to see if it was a persistence issue.  Same result.

Not sure where the email addresses are stored for notifications.
