Decide whether to allow writes to (local snapshot of) import variables


Original issue 375 created by ihab.awad on 2008-06-03T22:49:36.000Z:
To support the JS idiom of feature testing --
if (!foo) {
foo = function() { ... }
}
we should allow variables obtained from IMPORTS___ to be written to, and
readImport(...) should just return 'undefined' if some import variable is
not provided by the container.
Optionally, we can provide a way for a module author to specify that a
given import variable is "required".
