Consider moving AMO API session auth to cookies


addons-frontend uses a JWT for logins but recently, in #4590 , we had to tie the JWT ID to a database table to implement log out we had to store a copy of the JWT in a cookie so it can be deleted on log out.
As this helpful flowcart illustrates, this means we have essentially reinvented session cookies.
The danger with sticking with JWTs is that they have a poor security track record and are still a relatively new technology. Session cookies are battle tested. If we don't benefit from the JWT part, maybe we should switch? It will probably make the code a lot simpler.
There could be some cross-origin considerations since it's sometimes convenient to develop addons-frontend locally against a hosted dev API so I don't know if that makes traditional session cookies more difficult or not.
