JQuery 2.1.1 Version


Original issue 1945 created by pradeep.niet07 on 2014-12-03T15:47:44.000Z:
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
I see error (in the chrome console)
"In strict mode code, functions can only be declared at top level or immediately within another function."
On the other hand, version
2.1.0/jquery.min.js and 2.1.1/jquery.js are loading just fine.
Please see the attachment.
