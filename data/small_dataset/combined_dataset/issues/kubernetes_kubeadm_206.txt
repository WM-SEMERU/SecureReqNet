Support certificate rotation


[FEATURE REQUEST]
We need some way to rotate certificates.  Right now we mint certs that expire after 1 year and we have no built in provision to rotate them.
We should either have components manage rotating their own certificates (and writing the certs back to the kubeconfig) or have a way to easily do this from the outside without disrupting a running cluster.  Notifying users when rotation is necessary should be part of our design here too.
