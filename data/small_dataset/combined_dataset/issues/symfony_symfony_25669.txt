If the security token in the session can't be unserialized, an E_NOTICE is issued. This prevents it (and provides a better log message if it's not even a __PHP_Incomplete_Class).
This is similar to #24731, but I saw it triggered when changing OAuth library (elifesciences/journal#824), so the token class itself no longer exists. (I want to avoid having to manually invalidate all sessions, as not all sessions use that token class.)
