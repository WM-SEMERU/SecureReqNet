App won’t start on IPad Air 2 after 1.9 and later


Description:
When updating to 1.9 I noticed that the app just wouldn’t want to start on my iPad Air 2 and 1.9.1 did no difference. It just starts a white screen and nothing more pops up. I have tried reinstalling the app two time. One time on 1.9 and one time on 1.9.1.
