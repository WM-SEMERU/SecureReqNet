simple_preauth and anonymous


I have a firewall configuration like below. The anonymous statement does not work when using simple_preauth. I'm not sure if that is intended behavior?
        secured_area:
            pattern:    ^/(.+)
            stateless: true
            anonymous: ~
            simple_preauth:
                authenticator: apikey_authenticator
