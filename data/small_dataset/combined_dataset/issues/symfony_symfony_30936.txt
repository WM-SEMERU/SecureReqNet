Using "Foo", a class name that corresponds to no less than 22 fixture
classes, results in the first found "Foo" being loaded when one is
found by the ClassNotFoundFatalErrorHandler error handler, I am not sure
exactly why, but it is not really a big issue because this is a fatal
error handler and execution is not supposed to continue after that.
Except that is very much the case when running the whole test suite
sequentially with ./phpunit . Then we arrive to the DI component test
suite, and a failure happens because \foo was not supposed to be defined:

Failed asserting that exception message 'The definition for "\foo" has
no class attribute, and appears to reference a class or interface in the
global namespace. Leaving out the "class" attribute is only allowed for
namespaced classes. Please specify the class attribute explicitly to get
rid of this error.' contains 'The definition for "\foo" has no class.'.
