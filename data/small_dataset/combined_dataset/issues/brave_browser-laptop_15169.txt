Get rid of dangerous reload/back buttons on MacBook Pro Touch Bar


Description
Touch Bar is very sensitive so you can lose work when your fingers stray a bit past the number row on MacBook Pros â€” reloading websites or navigating back.
Steps to Reproduce

Go to some web form and start typing in stuff.
Accidentally hit Touch Bar reload instead of typing 3 or back arrow instead of typing 4.
Watch your work vanish.

Actual result:
Lose work or maybe just give yourself distracting change of context and navigational hassles.
Expected result:
Brave doesn't expose high-risk keys like this.
Reproduces how often:
Every time you don't type flawlessly.
Brave Version
Version 0.55.1 Chromium: 70.0.3528.4 (Official Build) dev (64-bit)
MacOS Mojave beta 10
Reproducible on current live release:
Yes
Additional Information
I complained about this with Chrome and the devs said they wouldn't have exposed back and reload keys on Touch Bar if they knew then what they know now. But now the buttons are widely used so they don't think they should: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=865948
Fortunately Chrome lets you shut off Touch Bar keys altogether, which works well enough for me (especially since I use Cmd-R to reload and Cmd-left arrow to go backward and don't need the Touch Bar buttons, but that's just me, I know.)
