Does not prompt for authentication for CUPS web GUI


Description
Unable to administer printers with CUPS's web interface. Recent version of Brave, starting at version Version 0.55.18 Chromium: 70.0.3538.67 (Official Build) (64-bit), does not prompt for user authentication. Instead, it immediately loads an unauthorized user page. Note that this computer is running Ubuntu version 18.04.
On another laptop running Ubuntu 16.04.5 and Version 0.25.2 Chromium: 69.0.3497.100 of Brave works as expected.
Steps to Reproduce

Install version 0.55.18
Navigate to localhost:631/admin, while running the cups daemon.
Click Add Printers
