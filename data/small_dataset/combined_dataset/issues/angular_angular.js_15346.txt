fix(security): do not auto-bootstrap when loaded from an extension.


Extension URIs (resource://...) bypass Content-Security-Policy in Chrome and
Firefox and can always be loaded. Now if a site already has a XSS bug, and uses
CSP to protect itself, but the user has an extension installed that uses
Angular, an attacked can load Angular from the extension, and Angular's
auto-bootstrapping can be used to bypass the victim site's CSP protection.
Notes:

isAutoBootstrapAllowed must be initialized on load, so that currentScript
is set correctly.
The tests are a bit indirect as reproducing the actual scenario is too
complicated to reproduce (requires signing an extension etc). I have confirmed
this to be working manually.
