Provide MSAL token cache implementations


If you are authenticating your .NET Core app against Azure AD the suggested path is to use the MSAL library.  This requires code to load/serialise the TokenCache before/after every access and sample code is provided here
The code is not great as it uses the Session to hold the token cache and there are some issues with MSAL as the Load/Persist methods are not asynchronous.
Given that every application would need to include such code, is it in scope to provide this in an official library along with implementations that use IMemoryCache/IDistributedCache?
There's also the next step of constructing a ConfidentialClientApplication to acquire a token but this might be a bit more open to interpretation
