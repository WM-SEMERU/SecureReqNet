This PR is a follow up of #30592 by @XuruDragon, with two main differences:

I think ScopingHttpClient might be a better name for what is called a ConditionalHttpClient there,
the FrameworkBundle part is removed so that it can be submitted separately later on.

With a ScopingHttpClient, you can add some default options conditionally based on the requested URL and a regexp that it should match. This allows building clients that add e.g. credentials based on the requested scheme/host/path.
When the requested URL is a relative one, a default index can be provided - whose corresponding default options (the base_uri one especially) will be used to turn it into an absolute URL.
Regexps are anchored on their left side.
E.g. this defines a client that will send some github token when a request is made to the corresponding API, and will not send those credentials if any other host is requested, while also turning relative URLs to github ones:
$client = HttpClient::create();
$githubClient = new ScopingClient($client, [
    'http://api\.github\.com/' => [
        'base_uri' => 'http://api.github.com/',
        'headers' => ['Authorization: token '.$githubToken],
    ],
], 'http://api\.github\.com/');
Of course, it's possible to define several regexps as keys so that one can create a client that is authenticated against several hosts/paths.
