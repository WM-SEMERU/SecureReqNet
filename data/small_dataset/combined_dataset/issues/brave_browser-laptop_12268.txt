Remove unnecessary hosts from Brave index*.html CSP


Removes all search provider autocomplete hosts and the following hosts from the connect-src directive:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/adblock-data/ https://s3.amazonaws.com/safe-browsing-data/ https://s3.amazonaws.com/tracking-protection-data/ https://s3.amazonaws.com/https-everywhere-data/ https://brave-download.global.ssl.fastly.net https://brave-laptop-updates.global.ssl.fastly.net https://laptop-updates-pre.brave.com https://brave-laptop-updates-pre.brave.com
These are not necessary to whitelist in CSP since they are only connected to from the main process, not the renderer process.
fix #12263
Test Plan:

automated test passes
Delete httpse.json, *.dat, and Extensions/jdbefljfgobbmcidnmpjamcbhnbphjnb/ in your brave APP_DATA directory (ex: /Users/yan/Library/Application Support/Brave)
Build a package if not running from a pre-packaged version of brave: CHANNEL=dev npm run build-package
Open the packaged version of Brave
Click 'Check for updates' from the file menu. It should show that no updates are available instead of an error.
Make sure opening a PDF works
Make sure HTTPS Everywhere works using https://https-everywhere.badssl.com/
Go to settings -> turn on Autocomplete search term as you type. Type some words in the URL bar and you should see the query autocompleted.
