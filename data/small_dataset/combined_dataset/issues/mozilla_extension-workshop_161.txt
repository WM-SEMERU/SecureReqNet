Review the assets directory for JS/CSS that should be consumed as packages


There's some libs in the assets directory that might be available as deps. If this is the case let's switch them to external dependencies so we can benefit from updates.
For cases where these aren't external dependencies let's file upstream bugs to ask the maintainers to package their code where possible.
