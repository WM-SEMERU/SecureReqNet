Add ReconnectPolicyBuilder to SignalR TS client


Epic #8797
See https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/8566/files#r266168117
var reconnectPolicy =  new ReconnectPolicyBuilder()
    .withExponentialBackoff()
    .withDelayIntervals(1,2,5,10, 30)
    .maxRetries(5)  //These last two options wouldn't be used with the withDelayIntervals option
    .withConstantDelay(10)
    .build()
We'd have to consider how to best handle conflicting options being configured.
