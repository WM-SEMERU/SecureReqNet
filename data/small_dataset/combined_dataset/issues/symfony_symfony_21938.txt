So with the UserLoaderInterface replacing UserProviderInterface, the ability to declare a custom refreshUser method has been taken away. The user still gets refreshed on each request.

How can we define a custom method that will refresh the user? i.e. you might want to join the query on roles tables if you intend to refresh roles on each request
How can we stop the user being refreshed / reloaded completely on each request? With the custom refreshUser method it was an opportunity to suppres reloading from db for apps that don't need / care about this.
