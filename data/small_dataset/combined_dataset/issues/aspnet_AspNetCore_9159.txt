Custom Operation for UseDeveloperExceptionPage


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I want to log the error to database, for UseExceptionHandler, we could custom it in public static IApplicationBuilder UseExceptionHandler(this IApplicationBuilder app, Action<IApplicationBuilder> configure), but for UseDeveloperExceptionPage, there is no such operation.
Describe the solution you'd like
Provider the Action<IApplicationBuilder> configure in UseDeveloperExceptionPage
