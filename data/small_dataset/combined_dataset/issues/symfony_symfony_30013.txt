From the linked issue:

The current logic is the following:

when a route is declared with a trailing slash, the trimmed-slash url is redirected to the one with the slash
when a route is declared with no trailing slash, the slashed url is redirected to the trimmed-slash one

That includes routes with slash-greedy requirements: when the same greedy requirement matches both the slashed and the trimmed-slash URLs, only one of them is considered the canonical one and a redirection happens.
We could fine tune this logic and make an exception when a trailing slash-greedy requirement is declared with no explicit trailing slash after it. (ie disable any redirections for /foo/{.*} but keep it for /foo/{.*}/. That would mean /foo/bar and /foo/bar/ wouldn't trigger the redirection for route /foo/{.*}, breaking the "not-semantics" property of trailing slashes for catch-all routes. Which might be legit afterall.

This PR implements this fine tuning, as that's the most BC behavior (and thus the correct one).
See #30012 for testGreedyTrailingRequirement in action on 3.4 as a proof.
