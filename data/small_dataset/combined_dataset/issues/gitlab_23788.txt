Users are still able to download code from *public* projects with repository  
disabled or restricted only for team members.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a project with *public* visibility level
2. Go to project settings and set repository permissions to **disabled** or  **only team members **
3. Try to clone this same project without being a project member.

### Expected behavior

User should see a 403 error

### Actual behavior

Repository is being cloned!!!

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

We should also improve the description of public visibility level since now  
public projects can have restricted repositories

### Possible fixes

 check `app/controllers/projects/git_http_controller.rb:78`  

``` ruby
  def upload_pack_allowed?
    return false unless Gitlab.config.gitlab_shell.upload_pack

    if user
      access_check.allowed?
    else
      ci? || project.public?
    end
  end
```
We should improve the permissions check here and look for other security issues about
cloning and pushing code when project is public.
