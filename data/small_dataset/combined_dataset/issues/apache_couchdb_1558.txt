Prevent modification of /_users/_security object with opt-out ini file setting


Expected Behavior
Modifying the _security object inside of _users is unsupported, and can lead to some unusual behaviour - see #1556.
Current Behavior
We allow people to shoot themselves in the foot by modifying _users/_security.
Possible Solution
Always return a 403 on write attempts for _users/_security. @rnewson do you have any comment on this?
Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

dev/run -n 1 --with-admin-party-please
`curl -X PUT http://localhost:15984/_users/_security -d '{"foo": "bar"}'

Context
People are trying to change the rules for who can read/write documents in _users and it goes very badly.
