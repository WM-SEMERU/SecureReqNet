Implement native "open tab in background"


In Firefox, "open tab in background" can be enabled by edit "browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground" in about:config.
For brave/chrome, "open tab in background" can only be enabled by extensions (e.g. tabsplus/ForceInBackground), which is non-native and usually buggy. For example, for tabsplus/ForceInBackground, there will be a splash when the link is clicked and opened in background tab.
Highly appreciated if brave would implement a built-in "open tab in background" option.
P.s. Wish brave can be more customizable just like Firefox.
