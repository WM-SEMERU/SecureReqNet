Update github.com/coreos/go-oidc package to latest


A few months ago we update go-oidc after having a lot of issues with compliance around JWT parsing, the OAuth2 spec, cache header parsing, etc. The new package github.com/coreos/go-oidc replaces the existing packages github.com/coreos/go-oidc/{http,jose,keys,oauth2,oidc}.
Over the 1.7 release cycle we'd like to update the packages use for the API server and kubectl plugins. As part of this work, we'd like to also introduce some e2e tests for the OIDC plugin, so we can continue to ensure it functions properly.
Based on my estimations, this update would fix:

#37875 (oauth2 compliance)
coreos/go-oidc#136 (cache header parsing)
coreos/go-oidc#137 (less picky about metadata claims)
