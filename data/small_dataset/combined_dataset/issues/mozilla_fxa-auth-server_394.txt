Lock a user's account after X unsuccessful login attempts


Per #222 (comment)


lock a user's account after "x" total unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. By moving to X consecutive failed logins instead of resetting the quota after 1 hour, we may thwart attempts for attackers to throttle login requests to stay under suspicion. A fine line between "security" and mass inconvenience.
