This is pretty much a reopen of my previous issue: #13277
Setup
I have a configuration similar to this the following examples. 2 firewalls, of which 1 is not on the main context. This firewall is stateless and authenticates based on {something}.
route:
   pattern: /special-page/{something}/
# for the special page
firewall1:
    pattern: ^/special-page
    stateless: true

# for the rest of the site
firewall2:
    pattern: ^/

access_control:
  - ^/: FULLY
Scenario
I visit: /special-page/foo
I get redirected to /special-page/foo/
Result: Failure.
This scenario fails, because internally, Symfony sets a response, while still triggering the firewall:
Request {#9 ▼
  +attributes: ParameterBag {#12 ▼
    #parameters: array:8 [▼
      "_controller" => "Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\RedirectController::urlRedirectAction"
      "path" => "/some-page/some-value/"
      "permanent" => true
      "scheme" => null
      "httpPort" => 80
      "httpsPort" => 443
      "_route" => "app.some-route"
      "_route_params" => array:5 [▼
        "path" => "/some-page/some-value/"
        "permanent" => true
        "scheme" => null
        "httpPort" => 80
        "httpsPort" => 443
      ]
    ]
  }
}

In my authenticator, I request the token via $token = $request->attributes->get('token')). This fails because Symfony merely redirects to the page with the trailing slash.
Attempt to fix
I've tried to fix this with the following setup, now it will only match with trailing slash for that firewall. However, now it will try authenticate against firewall2, because this one still triggers on the redirect controller.
# for the special page
firewall1:
    pattern: ^/special-page/.*/
    stateless: true

# for the rest of the site
firewall2:
    pattern: ^/

access_control:
  - ^/: FULLY
Solution
I think that the Firewall should not match any requests if the _controller is Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\RedirectController::urlRedirectAction
