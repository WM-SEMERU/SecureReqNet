restricting access role-based rather than allowing it


I'd like to see a way to restrict access to users with specific roles, e.g. denying access to the registration page for an already logged-in user. Something like
security:
  access_control:
    - { path: ^/register, roles: [IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY, !IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY] }

(notice the !) would be nice, although that would require to specify the order of allow/deny like for Apache's Allow/Deny/Order directives.
But maybe such functionaliy is already available and I'm just not aware of that. Or if there's a different way of achieving this...
