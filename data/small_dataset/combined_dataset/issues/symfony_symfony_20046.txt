[DX] Make the user providers configuration more concise


Problem
I've always found that the security.providers configuration is a bit verbose.
Solution
Let's make the configuration more concise. Proposal:
Before
security:
    providers:
        administrators:
            memory:
                users:
                    ryan: { password: ryanpass, roles: 'ROLE_USER' }
                    admin: { password: kitten, roles: 'ROLE_ADMIN' }
        users:
            entity:
                class: AppBundle\Entity\User
                property: email
After
security:
    providers:
        administrators:
            ryan: { password: ryanpass, roles: 'ROLE_USER' }
            admin: { password: kitten, roles: 'ROLE_ADMIN' }
        users:
            entity: AppBundle\Entity\User
            property: email
