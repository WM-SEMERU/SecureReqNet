Proposal to add principle: Validate inputs and outputs


This is a rather common basic principle (if not the most common)
The main reason I think it should be added is that it cover many cases that other principles don't cover so well. It's not so much about checking the input of a certain flow can be syntactically validated (though it can be), but about having a large set of data created by service A being consumed by service B.
Eg:

service A produce html
service B is firefox and display said HTML in about:home

The principle here is about ensuring that service B will validate the data from service A is genuine by using specific control (in addition to any fraud detection, which has it's own principle already). In this case, it could be that the communication between API encrypted (data principle which is also present), but also that the data authenticity is validated in band + out of band (in band: authenticated API, out of band: signed)
