OBJECT_TO_POPULATE is meant to specify the top level object. The implementation left the option in the context and it would be used whenever we have the first element that matches the class. #30607 (to master) introduces the feature to also keep the instances of attributes to deeply populate an existing object tree. In both cases, we do not want the mix up to happen with what the current OBJECT_TO_POPULATE is.
