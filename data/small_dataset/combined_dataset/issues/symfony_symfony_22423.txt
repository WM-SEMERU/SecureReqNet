#18952
UsernamePasswordJsonAuthenticationListener seems to "high-jack" every request. While the documentation http://symfony.com/doc/master/security/json_login_setup.html seems to imply it supports things like check_path I do not see this in the code at all. It might make sense to extend from AbstractAuthenticationListener. At the very least the listener should check the Content-Type header if its a json request.
