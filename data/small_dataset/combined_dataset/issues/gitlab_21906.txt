Currently, the members table tracks two states that, I believe, should be split out:

* Invitation to join a group or project
* Request to join a group or project

Moving them into separate `access_requests` and `invitations` tables makes it much harder to mistakenly count one of these rows as a current, active  membership. There's also data loss at the moment when an access request is granted, which could be solved at the same time (request_at is just set to nil).

We treat invitations as current, active memberships at the moment, which I believe is inappropriate, but this issue is focusing on access requests, as they are the main security concern.
