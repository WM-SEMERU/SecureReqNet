Address bar doesn't change during "tabnapping" phishing attempt


Tested on Brave 0.9.4.
Brave, like many other browsers, is vulnerable to "tabnapping", where an attacker-controlled application opens a foreground tab to a trusted website, and after the user judges the website is safe, the attacker uses window.location to replace the foreground tab with a malicious document.
A proof of concept is available here: http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/switch/
Clicking "Do it" opens a new tab with a bank login page. After 7.5 seconds, the page will be transparently replaced with a data: URI of a fake bank login page.
In all other browsers, the address bar will change to the data: URI, thus alerting a keen-eyed user.
In Brave, the address bar does not change. (To make matters worse, even if this is fixed, in brave-laptop you also have to hover over the title bar to even see the address.
The only tell-tale sign that something is happening is a new page is added to the history list, so the "back" button becomes active.
To test the above PoC on Brave, you might want to save the page and edit the "bank_html" to some other text, as a proof that the page is being replaced. Otherwise, there's no indication of it happening.
Even if Brave doesn't wish to block this kind of attack altogether (and possibly break behaving websites that use it for legitimate reasons), at least change the address in the location bar, and perhaps make it visible for a moment, so the user would have a chance to see something strange is going on.
brave-android behaves differently:
Once the window.location is modified with a data: URI, it launches Chrome.
The browser might also forget to change the address bar during a "reverse tabnapping", where the opened tab can affect the opener tab using window.opener.location.assign, but I did not test that.
