While investigating why AuthenticationEvents::AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESS is not dispatched, noticed similarity between AccessListener and AuthorizationChecker and the only real difference is alwaysAuthenticate flag.
Case 1:
When UsernamePasswordToken is serialized it will be serialized with state of authenticated,
so when application will load token from session AccessListener won't call authenticate because authenticated=true, even if alwaysAuthenticate=true
Case 2:
User A has roles foo, bar and admin, User A is signed-in into application and token is persisted, later another User B with role admin, decided to restrict role admin for User A, so User A won't lose it's privileges until session is expired or logout, because token is persisted with roles and authenticated=true and AccessListener does not call authenticate even if alwaysAuthenticate=true
TODO

 - reuse AuthorizationChecker in AccessListener
 - adjust unit tests
 - add deprecation notices
 - update CHANGELOG and UPGRADE*
