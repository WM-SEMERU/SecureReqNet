This PR uses the new ArgumentResolver to inject a security user when the signature implies so. This is based on the docs code example and existing pr on the SFEB.
With the new example you can do the following:
// when a User is mandatory, e.g. behind firewall
public function fooAction(UserInterface $user)

// when a User is optional, e.g. where it can be anonymous
public function barAction(UserInterface $user = null)
This deprecates the Controller::getUser() method.
I have added it on a priority of 40 so it falls just under the RequestValueResolver. This is because it's already used and the initial performance is less of an impact.
There was a comment asking if the controller_argument.value_resolver tag name wasn't too long. If decided this tag should change before 3.1 is released, I will update it in here.
RequestValueResolver contains a small codestyle consistency fix.
