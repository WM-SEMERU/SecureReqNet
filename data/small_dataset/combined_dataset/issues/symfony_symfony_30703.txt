[Property-Access] Can't handle setters with variadic arguments


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2
Description
PropertyAccessor class does not check if a method has variadic arguments, and therefore doesn't call them with "...$value" as parameter, but as an array, which triggers an error.
How to reproduce
Define a class with a setter with one variadic argument. Try to set the value via property-access.
Possible Solution
There should be a type "ACCESS_METHOD_VARIADIC" which handles this case. ReflectionParameter has a method called "isVariadic" to check if a method / function parameter is variadic.
