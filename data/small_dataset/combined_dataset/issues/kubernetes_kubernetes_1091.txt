Authenticated docker pulls


This is just a strawman to get the conversation going. While this PR is functional, I don't think this is the right solution.
I've only got one major requirement for this feature, and it is not accomplished in this PR: the kubelet must be able to pull from multiple registries, each with their own set of credentials.
To meet this requirement, I see three reasonable options:

configure kubelet from dockercfg
configure kubelet from CLI flags
add docker creds to container manifest

Any thoughts out there?
