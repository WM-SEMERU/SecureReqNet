disable webusb API


Test plan
See #13375
Original issue description
webusb can be used to bypass yubikey phishing protection at the moment: https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-yubikey-phishing-webusb/ -> we should disable navigator.usb
@flamsmark also suggested disabling navigator.bluetooth
maybe also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon ?
