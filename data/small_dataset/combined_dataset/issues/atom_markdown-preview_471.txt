Description
markdown-preview doesn't black- or white-list HTML tags, this can create some scary vulnerabilities because the HTML is rendered in a div rather than a web-view as recommended in atom/atom#1684.
Steps to Reproduce

Launch Atom in your local atom repository
Open the README.md
Press Ctrl+Shift+M to open the Markdown Preview
Inspect the DOM

Expected behavior: Markdown preview should be rendered within a web-view
Actual behavior: Markdown preview is rendered within a div
