ngSanitize-ed content fetches external resources (img[src])


For some applications like email clients, it's important that the interaction with the sanitized content is not signaled via external http requests.
The sanitizer today doesn't take this requirement into account and allows external content to be fetched.
We should do one of:

implement a mode where the external resources are stripped from the sanitized content
document this behavior and point to alternative more fully-featured sanitizers that are more suitable for these applications
