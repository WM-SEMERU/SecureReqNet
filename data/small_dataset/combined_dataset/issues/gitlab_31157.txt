'### Summary

Wiki page appear in search results even though wiki permission is set to _Only team members_. 

### Steps to reproduce

- Create project with wiki pages.
- Change wiki permission to _Only team members_.
- Change project visibility to _public_.
- Search the project as an unauthorized user (or internal user who isn't part from the project group) e.g. http://localhost:3000/search?project_id=[project_id]&scope=wiki_blobs&search=a

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Show the content of wiki pages that matches the searched query.

Though opening the wiki pages directly result in: Access denied.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Not to show wiki pages.

Same issue when the project visibility is _internal_ and a user outside the project group search.
