Add check that expansion has fired on all nodes


Original issue 213 created by ihab.awad on 2008-04-23T22:49:31.000Z:
Implement the following algorithm around the JS rewriter to make sure that
we did not simply miss calling expand(...) on some subtree:
Mark all tree nodes with UNEXPANDED.
Apply rules
Rule.expand removes UNEXPANDED from its return value.
ParseTreeNodes.clone does not clone UNEXPANDED.
Walk tree making sure no nodes are UNEXPANDED
