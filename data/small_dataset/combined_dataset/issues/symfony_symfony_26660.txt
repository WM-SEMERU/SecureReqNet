This is a follow-up for #26263
As discussed there I propose to allow using custom functions as a new feature only and thus targeting master here.
If we agree to move forward with this there are some todos:

 fix tests
 add cache warmer for allow_if expressions
 update documentation to mention this new feature
 update UPGRADE files
