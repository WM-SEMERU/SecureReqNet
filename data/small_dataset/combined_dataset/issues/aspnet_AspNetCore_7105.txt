Replace JObject with JsonDocument in Authentication


#4260

"Drop in" replacement with some odd gymnastics sometimes.
It's not as breaking as I thought it might be for derived OAuth handlers. ClaimActions shield them from most of the changes. They primarily have to call Parse with the new type. @PinpointTownes
Users doing advanced claims mapping or inspection via events may be broken.
Also fixed launch settings so the samples would work again.
