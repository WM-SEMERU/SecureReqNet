What is the good time for the Security WG monthly meeting


Currently it's once a month on Thursdays at UTC 19:00 (07:00 PM):
It seems it conflicts with some other meetings. Can you please suggest other times?
edit: Please specify all available times and days in the week that you will be able to attend: https://doodle.com/poll/2s5qr4xhgvkh2syg

You may suggest a new time if it's not showing up on the poll
