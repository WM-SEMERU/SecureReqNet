cmd/link: support buildmode=pie with internal linking (on Android)


With Termux it's now within reach to run all.bash directly an Android device  without a host. Termux is an Android app that includes a complete Linux environment, including the NDK C toolchain.
However, I'm stopped by an unfortunate chain of constraints:

Android only run PIE binaries, so buildmode=pie must be set in cmd/dist (https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/170943).
Buildmode=pie forces external linking (#18968)
External linking requires that the g register is allocated to TLS storage.
Android doesn't support native ELF TLS storage (yet), so runtime/cgo is needed for setting up the g register storage at initialization using the pthread API.
cmd/dist doesn't know how to build runtime/cgo.

Of the above conditions, 1, 3 and 4 are outside our control and I don't think we want to fix 5.
This issue is about relaxing 2, so buildmode=pie no longer requires external linking.
