Create tests to ensure that no untested JavaScript constructs appear in cajoler output


Original issue 538 created by zestyping on 2008-06-12T06:55:27.000Z:
It's important not to let the cajoler get out of sync with your
specification and test suite for the subset of JavaScript used
in cajoled code.  So, create a suite of tests that checks that the
cajoler produces only the constructs you expect.  (For example, give
several samples of large Caja programs as input, and parse the
cajoled output to verify that it contains only constructs from the
set of JavaScript constructs you have specified and tested.)
