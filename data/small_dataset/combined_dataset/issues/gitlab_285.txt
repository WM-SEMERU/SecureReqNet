The object returned by `/projects/:id/merge_request/:merge_request_id` does not contain the MR creation time, however you can view it on the web UI.

The reason is that we'd like to know which merge requests are "stuck" by polling on the open ones and sending a daily email with ones older than X days.

Also on [github](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/issues/6902), you should probably close the issues there.
