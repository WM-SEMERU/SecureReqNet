That helps when using the Mime component to create a form submission HTTP body (where you need to merge the headers of the MIME body with the HTTP headers):
$body->getPreparedHeaders()->toArray();

vs

foreach ($body->getPreparedHeaders()->getAll() as $header) {
      $headers[] = $header->toString();
}
