Expected argument of type "App\Entity\Test or null", "array" given at property path "Test"


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.2
Description
I am not sure if this is a bug or if i did something wrong.
I'm trying to create a form with an EntityType. If I do it without a FormType it works well, but if I put my form builder in a FormType, I get the error :
"Expected argument of type "App\Entity\Test or null", "array" given at property path "Test"" when using a form type."
I suppose it is caused by the name of the rendered element : name="form[test][test]" with a FormType, form[test] without.
Thanks for your help !
