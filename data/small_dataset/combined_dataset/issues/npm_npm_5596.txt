Security issue: npm to install executables as user 'nobody'


It is a security issue of large proportion that npm -g installs executables as user 'nobody'. The 'nobody' user should not have write access to any files on a system let alone a whole bunch of libraries and executables. And especially not when those files are intended to be relied upon in the main runnings of the server.
The proper way to do it, would be

for npm to register a user 'npm' upon installation, and use this user during build and install, or
for npm to build files as 'nobody' in a temporary location, and install built files with ownership 'root', then delete all files owned by 'nobody', or better still
combine the two, have npm build as 'npm' but install as 'root'

Having files owned by 'nobody' is like saying to an intruder: "We won't give you root access, but don't worry, you can write to all our crucial files anyway. Enjoy!"
