Add hasToken() to AuthorizationChecker


I think we should add hasToken() to AuthorizationChecker.
This code would be needed in AuthorizationChecker:
public function hasToken() {
    return (null === ($token = $this->tokenStorage->getToken()));
}
Reason / Usage:
I like to redirect an user to route x if:

the user is logged in,
and the user is not already on route x (prevent recursion),
and the user has not done y (any special case).

In my event listener I use this code:
if (!$this->authChecker->isGranted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED')) {
   return;
}

If I try to access the Symfony profiler I'll get this error:
The token storage contains no authentication token. One possible reason may be that there is no firewall configured for this URL.

I think catch the AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException is not the best solution. My code should check if the tokenStorage contains a token. That because I need to inject the TokenStorage.
It would be less code if the AuthorizationChecker would have a hasToken() function to check if calling isGranted() is allowed.
