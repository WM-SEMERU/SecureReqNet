navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices() returns too much info


Test plan
See #14970
Original issue description
STR:

cd test/fixtures and start a local server, ex: on port 8000
go to localhost:PORT/enumerate_devices.html

Actual result: shows a description of every media device
Expected result: behaves the same as in Chrome (no device descriptions are shown, only an opaque ID).
Tested on MacOS, both master and current release (0.23.x).
