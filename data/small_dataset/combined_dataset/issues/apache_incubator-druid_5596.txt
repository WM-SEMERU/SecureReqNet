Fix Kerberos Authentication failing requests without cookies and excludedPaths config.


KerberosAuthenticator was failing First request from the clients.
After authentication we were setting the cookie properly but not
setting the the authenticated flag in the request. This PR fixes that.
Additional Fixes -

Excluded paths config - It was not working as expected. Requests for excluded paths were still failing. Fixed this by adding authentication result with anonymous user.
Removing of Unused SpnegoFilterConfig - replaced by
KerberosAuthenticator
removed unused internalClientKeytab and principal configs from KerberosAuthenticator
Fix docs accordingly and add docs for configuring an escalated
client.

Reproducing the Issue -

Configure Kerberos Security
Perform Kinit on client side and send an HTTP request to any druid endpoint
Druid returns unauthorized error  with a set-cookie flag. ----- HERE druid should have returned a 200 OK
Using the cookie on subsequent requests works fine.
