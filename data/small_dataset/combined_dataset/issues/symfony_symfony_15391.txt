UserSwitch requires redirect?


Hi,
Right now the \Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\SwitchUserListener::handle() sets a RedirectResponse.
I would like to trigger for example a POST request that should already be executed as the "switched" user. This is working if I remove the $event->setResponse line.
But I guess this code is there for a reason? If not I'd create a new config option for the userswitch to work on the first request (this could then also work for stateless authentication)
