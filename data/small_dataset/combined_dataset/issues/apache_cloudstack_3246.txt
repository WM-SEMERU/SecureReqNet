[WIP DO NOT MERGE] server: allow disk offering selection for volume from snapshot


Description
Problem: Volume created from a snapshot does not show its disk offering.
Root Cause: The volume created from a snapshot of a root disk does not have a disk offering therefore the disk offering of the created volume from the snapshot is empty.
Solution: Refactored createVolume API and extended UI to allow user to select disk offering while creating volumes using a root disk volume snapshot. For creating volumes using data disk volume snapshot, disk offering given by snapshot will be assigned. Disk offering selection in UI form volume creation from snapshot is depicted in screenshot below.
