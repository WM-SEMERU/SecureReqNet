security issues with URP logic

there are 2 security improvements we should make to the URP logic:

         service.fetchCustomHeaders() { headers, error in 




, custom headers fetched from the server should only be accepted if the header name is X-Brave-Partner; otherwise log/throw an error. This prevents an attacker who controls the Brave endpoint from being able to set any headers other than X-Brave-Partner.


for Coinbase, which uses cookies instead of headers, you should do some additional validation before inserting the cookie(s) into the cookie store (https://github.com/brave/brave-ios/pull/823/files#diff-60f6d7911cf19ceb7bcfcde55f9bc740R240): (a) validate that the cookie is being inserted only for coinbase.com, otherwise throw an error; (b) validate that the cookie name is __Secure-X-Brave-Partner.
