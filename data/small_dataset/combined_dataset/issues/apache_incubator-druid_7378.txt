After the pause is unsuccessful the supervisor kills the task
2019-03-26T17:39:59,213 ERROR [KafkaIndexTaskClient-crash_kafka-2] io.druid.indexing.kafka.KafkaIndexTaskClient - Task [index_kafka_crash_kafka_26413ac1d0cf193_paphciek] failed to pause, aborting

Haven't gotten a chance to investigate why pause is unsuccessful.
