Using vertical bar in node name messes up consul members pretty output


Description of the Issue
Created consul agent with node name: test | 2D33AE (everything works fine), but when running consul members, the 2D33AE is pushed into the Address Column, and everything else is shifted one a long.
EG:
Node                 Address           Status            Type    Build   Protocol  DC            Segment
extra-mac            <redacted>        alive             client  1.0.6   2         dc1           <default>
test-win7            <redacted>        left              client  1.0.6   2         dc1           <default>
test-win7            2D33AE            <redacted>        alive   client  1.0.6     2             dc1           <default>
