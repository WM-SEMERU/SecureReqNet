This is a proof-of-concept. Once we agree / are happy, I need to add this to all of the other authentication mechanisms that recently got the session migration code & add tests.
Basically, this avoids migrating the session if the firewall is stateless. There were 2 options to do this:
A) Make the SessionAuthenticationStrategy aware of all stateless firewalls. This is the current approach
or
B) Make each individual authentication listener aware whether or not its firewall is stateless.
