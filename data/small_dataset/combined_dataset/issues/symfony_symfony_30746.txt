Database AWS Endpoint URL


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.4
Description
symfony does not accept AWS RDS endpoint URL.
eg.    test.ctekhgnt6wpc.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com
In my .env file
DATABASE_URL=mysql://aditestuser:hello123@test.ctekhgnt6wpc.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com/testdb
but the same works if i access through mysql workbench.
if i dump schema or run any query, it throws error:
SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'adirai1122'@'172.31.4.155' (using password: YES)
the url displayed in exception does not match.
