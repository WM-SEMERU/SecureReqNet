Fix translation from kube-dns to CoreDNS Config to skip invalid values


What type of PR is this?
/kind bug
What this PR does / why we need it:
Kube-dns now accepts service name for stubdomain and nameserver, while CoreDNS does not support this feature.
As a result, a user having service name in stubdomains/nameserver in their kube-dns ConfigMap while migrating to CoreDNS will result in an invalid CoreDNS Config, resulting in a broken k8s cluster.
The translation will now detect a service name and omit it while translating to the equivalent CoreDNS Config and additionally warn the user that it has been omitted during translation since it's not supported.
Which issue(s) this PR fixes:
Fixes kubernetes/kubeadm#1473
Special notes for your reviewer:
Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
 `StubDomains` and `Upstreamnameserver` which contains a service name will be omitted while translating to the equivalent CoreDNS config.
