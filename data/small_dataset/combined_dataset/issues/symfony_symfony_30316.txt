`.env`: Make MAILER_URL and DATABASE_URL consistent


Description
Use either the form username:password@server or server?username=&password= for all connection url strings in .env
https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#configuring-the-database says

DATABASE_URL="mysql://db_user:db_password@127.0.0.1:3306/db_name"

whereas https://symfony.com/doc/current/email.html#configuration says

MAILER_URL=smtp://localhost:25?encryption=ssl&auth_mode=login&username=&password=

And (weirdly enough), the .env.dist file itself contains this example:

For Gmail as a transport, use: "gmail://username:password@localhost"

So I'm suggesting to make it consistent for all!
Besides, how to escape special characters should be explained better. https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#configuring-the-database has a dedicated alert box about this, https://symfony.com/doc/current/email.html#configuration just has a comment in the code. So I'd suggest to copy the alert box to the email docs as well. Should I do that?
Is the parsing of the .env file done per package or centrally? If centrally, then maybe the escaping question should rather be explained at https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dotenv.html ?
