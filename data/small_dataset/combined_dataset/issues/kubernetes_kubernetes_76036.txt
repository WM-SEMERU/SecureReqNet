Conformance image doesn't save results on failure


https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blame/master/cluster/images/conformance/run_e2e.sh#L16
What happened:
Running Sonobuoy with the upstream conformance image hangs if there are failures. Ginkgo returns a status code of 1 when the failure happens leading to the script to exit before saving the results. This leaves the sonobuoy worker just waiting for results.
What you expected to happen:
The results should be saved regardless of whether or not the ginkgo tests pass or fail.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Running the tests with an invalid regexp will cause the framework to panic:
sonobuoy run --e2e-focus="\\" --wait

You can watch the output of sonobuoy status to see that sonobuoy still thinks the plugin is running and the worker is still waiting for results.
Anything else we need to know?:
Its not out of the question that sonobuoy should be able to figure out the error state and report it, but the results should be reported as well; this is the same error condition you get when you get 1 test fail out fo 100.
Proposed solution:
The most simple solution is to remove the set -o errexit from the script; is there a particular reason it is there?
The original script here https://github.com/heptio/kube-conformance/blob/master/run_e2e.sh does not have that set.
Environment:

Kubernetes version (use kubectl version): 1.14.0
Cloud provider or hardware configuration: KIND
Install tools: Sonobuoy 0.14.0
