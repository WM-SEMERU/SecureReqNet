Consider building all packages with best practice security options


The following commits improved the build options for the runtime:

a76a2f5
df38461
7815d4f

... but our install scripts also build other packages which have not had these flags applied:

https://github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime/blob/master/installation/rhel-setup.sh
https://github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime/blob/master/installation/installation-setup.sh

Further, these options are not applied to OBS package builds for packages other than the runtime.
We should assess if all the new options we've added to the runtime can be applied to all other packages built in all environments.
