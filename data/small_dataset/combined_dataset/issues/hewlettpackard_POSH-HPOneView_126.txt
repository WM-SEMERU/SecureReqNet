New-HPOVLdapDirectory (2.0.436.0) -- Invalid credentials to connect to the directory X


Please fill in as much information as possible to help resolve your issue.
This can be labeled as a question as I'm unsure if it's an issue or just my environment.
I'd like to know what format the username input should be in.
Expected Behavior
Being able to create a new directory for the appliance.
Actual Behavior
Credentials are rejected time and again. I had it working at one point, but when I recreated the appliance it doesn't work again.
errorcode: AUTHN_LOGINDOMAIN_SERVER_CREDENTIALS_INCORRECT
message: Invalid credentials to connect to the directory X
HTTP 400 bad request.
When I look at the request using -Verbose, the username and password are 100% correct. I've tried multiple users and multiple ways of setting up the username:
netbios\username
username
username@fqdn
The password is a SecureString object.
When I input the exact same values in the UI everything goes right through.
