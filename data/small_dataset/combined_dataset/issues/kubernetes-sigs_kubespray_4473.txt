Fix ipip: false in calico v3


As of #3086 ipip is set but never used.
"spec": {
          "cidr": "{{ calico_pool_cidr | default(kube_pods_subnet) }}",
          "ipipMode": "{{ ipip_mode if ipip else 'Never' }}",
          "natOutgoing": {{ nat_outgoing|default(false) and not peer_with_router|default(false) }} }} "

Release notes don't mention this, so we can consider this a bug.
For example if you had ipip: false but left ipip_mode to its default value, it used to be enough to disable IP-in-IP encapsulation, but that's not the case anymore.
