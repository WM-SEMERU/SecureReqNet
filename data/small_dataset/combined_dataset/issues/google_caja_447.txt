Need to sanitize NAME=... attribute on HTML tags


Original issue 447 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-10T01:17:38.000Z:
Currently there is no sanitization of the value of NAME attributes.  A
document can use NAME="jimbob", and then Javascript adds a property named
jimbob to the global scope.  Of course, a malicious content provider could
provide some other name -- like something with trailing underscores or with
a trusted name like "caja" or "window".  Should fix this to validate the
value of all NAME attributes so that they are subject to the same
restrictions on variable names as Caja code is.
Maybe need to do the same to ID (and perhaps CLASS) attributes??
