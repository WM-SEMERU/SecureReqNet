.NET Core 3.0.0-preview4-27604-05 Runtime - blob not exist


I'm trying to build from source. When I run build.cmd, it tries to download .NET Core 3.0.0-preview4-27604-05 from this URL, but the URL says:

BlobNotFound - The specified blob does not exist.

So, where can I download that version of .NET Core to build the source code? Previous versions were worked correctly, but today when I've pulled the repository, this issue happens.
