Error getting a diff from latest state. param str (undefined) is not a string (AppStore.emitChanges)


Description
I manually built and ran brave. Everything fine. After adding some extensions, I noticed brave was continually using 100% of a cpu-core.
Steps to Reproduce

Manually build browser-laptop following this walkthrough.
Install extensions: pccckmaobkjjboncdfnnofkonhgpceea, clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne, hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd, lkcdgdbfbbnpnljlalmcjnepgjnmgigh, occjjkgifpmdgodlplnacmkejpdionan, nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk, cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm
Launch brave

Actual result:
Heavy CPU usage causing the browser to run slowly.
This error occurs many times:

Expected result:
No errors, lighter CPU use.
Reproduces how often:
Every time I launch the browser.
Brave Version
about:brave info:
about:brave doesn't show the version. I cloned the repository today (2018-09-02)

Reproducible on current live release:
No idea, I don't know how to add extensions in the main release (installed via repository).
Additional Information
I tried disabling individual extensions in the settings to figure out if a specific one was causing the problem. Upon doing so, all custom extensions disabled/enabled, making it impossible to figure out. Errors continue after (seemingly) disabling the custom extensions.
