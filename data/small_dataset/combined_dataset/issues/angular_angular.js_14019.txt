Remove the $sce context for the src attribute on video, audio, and source


Video, audio, and track sources require $sce.RESOURCE_URL, so by default you need a $sce.trustAsResourceUrl to set them dynamically if the resources are not on the same subdomain. This is not justified: no script execution is possible through the src attribute as far as the state of the art goes, so there's no reason to restrict it.
The change shouldn't be breaking: uses of $sce.trustAsResourceUrl before assigning to src or ng-src attributes will just be silently unwrapped.
(BTW, not sure about the amount of tests to add there. We have  already, I'm adding one of the new set, but adding the two others just doesn't seem productive)
