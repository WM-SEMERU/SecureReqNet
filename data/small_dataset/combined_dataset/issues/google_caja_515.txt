DomProcessingEvents.cdata should never be reached and is dangerous


Original issue 515 created by mikesamuel on 2008-06-11T22:27:34.000Z:
We do not whitelist any elements that take CDATA content.
Remove DomProcessingEvents.cdata, and make it's client issue an error if an
cdata node is seen by CompileHtml.
