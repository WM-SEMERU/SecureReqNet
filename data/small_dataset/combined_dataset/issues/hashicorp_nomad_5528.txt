[question] Preferred way to use privileged ports with "exec" driver?


Hi,
Let's say I want to run Fabio as a Nomad system job using the exec driver and have it listen on port 80; considering that the default user used by the exec driver is nobody and that it cannot bind to ports < 1024 by default, what is considered the best practice to achieve this (unless binding to privileged ports in Nomad services is frowned upon)?
I managed to achieve this by installing the Fabio binary locally on all Nomad clients and setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' fabio, but I'm not sure if this is considered best practice.
Moreover, I've been in the habit of downloading the binaries to run for jobs using the artifact stanza; however, I did not find any documentation relating to setting capabilities in the exec driver.


Is indeed not possible to bind to privileged ports with the exec driver and downloaded artifacts?


If it's not currently possible to do so, is it something that would eventually make sense for me to look into in adding terms of functionality to the exec driver?


Thanks!
