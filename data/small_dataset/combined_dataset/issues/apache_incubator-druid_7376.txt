Failing Broker Queries - Faulty Channel


Broker queries fail with Faulty Channel Exception
Description
This error occurs when the broker queries fail on MM due to improper shutdown of Peon Task. I have patched this locally by explicitly un-announcing the peon task before destroy is called

      curatorDruidNodeAnnouncer.unannounce(new DiscoveryDruidNode(
          new DruidNode(
              node.getServiceName(),
              node.getHost(),
              taskInfo.processHolder.port,
              taskInfo.processHolder.port,
              taskInfo.processHolder.tlsPort,
              node.isEnablePlaintextPort(),
              node.isEnableTlsPort()
          ),
          DruidNodeDiscoveryProvider.NODE_TYPE_PEON,
          ImmutableMap.of()
      ));

      try {
        log.info("Destroying task: %s . Sleeping for 10000 millis", taskid);
        Thread.sleep(10000);
      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        log.error("Sleep interuppedted for task: %s", taskid);
      }

      taskInfo.processHolder.process.destroy();

This is similar to #6043 but the exceptions reported there are slightly different.
