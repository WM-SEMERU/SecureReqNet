When working with user permissions, it's very convenient to switch between roles and the impersonating feature of Symfony is really useful for that.
http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/impersonating_user.html
Input field to choose the user to impersonate

Link to quit and return to the previous user

TODO LIST:

 Support customized URL parameter (_switch_user)
 Check roles with isGranted instead of looking at the list of roles
 Support customized role (ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH)
