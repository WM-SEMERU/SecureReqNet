test-security timeout does not work on build machines


Description
npm run test-security uses timeout to make sure that the browser process is terminated after 2 mins.
https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/blob/master/lib/start.js#L95
The timeout does not work on build machines, and the processes keep running even after 2 mins. Leading to an eventual abort.
