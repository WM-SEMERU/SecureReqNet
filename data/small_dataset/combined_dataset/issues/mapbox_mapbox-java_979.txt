Expected Behavior
Using a geocoder with the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android should support special characters. So the search Santa Catarina M치rtir,Puebla should yield results whether the Geocoding API call is initiated in a browser or via the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android.
Current Behavior
Expected results return when geocoding api request is initiated in a browser (i.e. in the Search Playground), but when using the SDK the raw geocoding API request URL includes the incorrect encoding for special character 치 so no results are returned.
Possible Solution
Steps to Reproduce

Run your app (including a geocoder) in Android Studio and use this code to log out the raw geocoding API request URL:

Log.d("GeocodingActivity", "onResponse: call.request() = " + call.request());


Enter the search "Santa Catarina M치rtir,Puebla" and grab the geocoding API request URL.
See that it doesn't return any results and the query contains incorrect encoding: https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/Santa+Catarina+M%25C3%25A1rtir%252CPuebla.json?access_token={{access-token}}&country=mx%2Cmx&types=poi%2Caddress&language=en
Compare to the same search with the same parameters in the Search Playground and the raw request: https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/Santa%20Catarina%20M%C3%A1rtir%2C%20puebla.json?access_token={{access_token}}&cachebuster=1551922406234&autocomplete=false&country=mx&limit=1&language=en

Context (Environment)
