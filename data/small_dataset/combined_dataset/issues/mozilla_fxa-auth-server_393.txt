Force users to re-auth if they log in from an "unfamiliar" country


Per #222 (comment)


if a user attempts to login from an "irregular" country (ie: they always log in from US/Canada but start getting strange login attempts from Egypt or Brazil) then we force them to confirm the login by email challenge or something. This could be possibly inconvenient for a certain number of users who travel frequently.
Also infers we somehow track/log a user's login history/location.
