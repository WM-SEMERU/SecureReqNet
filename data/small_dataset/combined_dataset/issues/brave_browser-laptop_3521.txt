Provide a way to see cert details from the urlbar hanger


This is how it looks currently:

Other browsers allow you to press a link that says details that shows the cert details.
We allow you to see cert details only when there's an error currently.
/cc @bradleyrichter for design, @diracdeltas for feedback, @darkdh for eventual implementation
