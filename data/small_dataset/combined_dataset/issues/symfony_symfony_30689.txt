[HttpFoundation] Invalid redirect Location


The Bug is here again - #22518
I can it reproduce. (the same case like #22517)
for example here is a code.
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/RedirectResponse.php#L39
The Code is not available more in actual state of code.
