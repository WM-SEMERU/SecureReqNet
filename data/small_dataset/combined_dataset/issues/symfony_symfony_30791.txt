Process::fromShellCommandline with "find .. -exec"


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.4
Description
        $process = Process::fromShellCommandline( 'find . -name "*.yml" ! -path "*/vendor/*" -exec vendor/bin/yaml-lint {} \;');
        $process->run();
I would like to make this command work, but it seems that the -exec is considered as some kind of special keyword by the Process component, or similar..?
using the very same command directly from the bash works as expected.
I am using this process in a symfony/console app and getting the following error
In LintCommand.php line 27:

  [Symfony\Component\Process\Exception\ProcessFailedException]
  The command "find . -name "*.yml" ! -path "*/vendor/*" -exec vendor/bin/yam
  l-lint {} \;" failed.

  Exit Code: 1(General error)

  Working directory: C:\xampp7.3\htdocs\linter

  Output:
  ================


  Error Output:
  ================
  find: missing argument to `-exec'
is this a bug, or do I used it wrong?
