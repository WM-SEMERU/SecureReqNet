Rethink Symfony Security docs

Newer attempt to reorganize all contents: #7293

 Authentication is not clearly explained (#6823)
 Better explain roles, attributes, expressions, ACL permission maps, etc. (#4158)
 Rewrite Firewall introduction (#4759)
 Add article showing an overview of the internals (#5289) (#7532) (#7297)
 Explain key concepts (e.g. Token), add flow diagrams, etc. (#6861)
