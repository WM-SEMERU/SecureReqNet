shield changes in PT are propagating to regular tabs


Description
Shield settings that are being changed under PT are also affecting the shields of regular tabs which shouldn't be happening. The behaviour should be as follows:

shield changes in a regular tab will propagate into PT and other tab types
shield changes in PT should never propagate into regular tabs and other tab types

Test plan / Steps to Reproduce

install & launch 0.23.205 81396b3
open https://jsfiddle.net/bkf50r8v/13/ in a regular tab
open https://jsfiddle.net/bkf50r8v/13/ in a PT tab
within the PT tab, change FP to Allow all fingerprinting
go back into the regular tab and refresh

Actual result:
Fingerprinting isn't working for the regular tab but is still enabled via the shields and Block 3rd Party is still enabled/selected.

Expected result:
Changing shields via PT shouldn't be affecting none PT tabs.
