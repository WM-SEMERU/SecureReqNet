Highlights can get into infinite loop, leaking memory under Linux


Note that this does not happen under OSX. I suspect node-oniguruma handles Unicode differently somehow.
To reproduce:

Create breaks.js or breaks.rb (for example), with the bytes 0x27 0xc3 0xbc 0x27 (base64 J8O8Jw==), which looks like 'Ã¼'.
Call the highlights command line utility on it. It never returns and its memory usage grows over time.
