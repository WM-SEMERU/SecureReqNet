Changing bottom bar position shouldn't reuqire a restart


Description 
Changing bottom bar position shouldn't reuqire a restart. Opera also has a similar option to switch from bottom bar to top navigation bar but doesn't require the browser to restart. We should have a similar approach. This could probably extend to hiding Rewards button as well.
