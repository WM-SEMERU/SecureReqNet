Accepting an invitation with an existing email leads to duplicate accounts


I sent an invitation to stefan@foo.com but accepted with stefan@bar.com, which was already in Minion. Now there are two accounts with email stefan@bar.com.
Marking this as critical because this could lead to really odd data corruption.
