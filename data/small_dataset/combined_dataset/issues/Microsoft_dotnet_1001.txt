BuildAppxSideloadPackageForUap ignored using .Net Core version 6.2.8


I have a big UWP project, and to optimize compilation time I've set BuildAppxSideloadPackageForUap to false in my csproj file, to prevent .Net Native compilation during Release appxupload creation.
Recently I've updated Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform NuGet package to version 6.2.8, and the flag seems to be completely ignored now.
