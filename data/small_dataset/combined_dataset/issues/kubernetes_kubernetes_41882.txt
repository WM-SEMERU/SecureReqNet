apiserver: self-signed in-memory cert for loopback


We had complicated logic before to find a matching (SNI- or server-) cert for the loopback device. In the worst case, bootstrapping failed because the provided certs didn't have the binding IP or localhost.
We now pass an artifical ServerName "apiserver-loopback-client" with the loopback client and install a self-signed in-memory cert+key into the server for that hostname. The client accepts the corresponding cert.
Fixing #41081
