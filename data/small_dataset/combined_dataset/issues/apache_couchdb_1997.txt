Fix #1988 - Validate attachment names at POST /db/doc and GET /db/doc/attachment


Overview
This PR solves the problem described at he issue #1988
PUT & POST operations for creating documents in a database enforce different validation rules over the attachment names of the new document.
When a document is created with a PUT operation "_foo.txt" is not accepted as a valid attachment name. If the document is created by a POST operation the "_foo.txt" attachment name is accepted.
This is an inconsistent behavoiur in the API as not accepted attachment names can be created.
Another inconsinstency is found in the GET attachment opperation that does not enforce the same attachment name validation rule that the rest of attachment operations DELETE/PUT.
Testing recommendations
Tests has been added into attachment_names.js test suite for testing attachment names during POST document creation and GET attachment retrieval.
make javascript suites="attachment_names"
