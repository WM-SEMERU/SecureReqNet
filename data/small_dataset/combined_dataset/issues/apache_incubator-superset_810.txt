User flow to request Acces to Dashboard


It's a bit tricky / heavy for content creators to provide access to Dashboards.
When users open a link to a dashboard or slice they don't have access to, here are a few things that could happen:

Error message
Request access button, maybe a field to specify which Admin user should get notified
A row is added in a AccessRequest model
Admins can go to the crud view for AccessRequest and see a list of request, filter to requests meant for them (or not), check a bunch of boxes of what they want to approve, and approve a set

There's a choice on whether the datasource perm should be added to one of the user's role, or if a new role that has the datasource should be added to the user's profile...
