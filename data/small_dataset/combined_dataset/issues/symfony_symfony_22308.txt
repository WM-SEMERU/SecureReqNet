One of the most frustrating limitations of the Security component config is that you can't define the firewalls in different files:
InvalidConfigurationException in PrototypedArrayNode.php line 325:

You are not allowed to define new elements for path "security.firewalls". Please
define all elements for this path in one config file.

But this could be so useful! Like in this example:
# app/config/dev/security.yml
security:
    firewalls:
        dev:
            pattern: ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
            security: false

# app/config/security.yml
security:
    # ...
    firewalls:
        main:
            # ...
So, my question for those experts in the internals of the Security component: would be really hard to remove this limitation? Maybe it's a matter of changing a few lines of code but nobody really tried to do that. Thanks!
