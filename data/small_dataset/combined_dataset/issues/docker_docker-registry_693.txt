Serve a TLS endpoint if REGISTRY_TLS_VERIFY is set and GUNICORN_OPTS is not


If REGISTRY_TLS_VERIFY is set, but GUNICORN_OPTS is not, then serve via a TLS endpoint instead of plain HTTP.
This is done by setting GUNICORN_OPTS to some default value, expecting the following files to be present:

/ssl/ca.crt
/ssl/registry.cert
/ssl/registry.key
