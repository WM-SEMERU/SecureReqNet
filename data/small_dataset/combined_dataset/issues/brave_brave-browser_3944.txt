Extension manifest.json homepage_url should default to Chrome Web Store URL


Description
In Chrome, if an extension does not specify the homepage_url field in the manifest.json, it defaults to the Chrome Web Store URL so right clicking the extension icon allows you to quickly navigate to it.
From the documentation:

If you distribute your extension using the Chrome Web Store, the homepage URL defaults to the extension's own page.
