URICallback issues


Original issue 475 created by jasvir on 2008-06-10T22:05:40.000Z:

Clarify the documention for URICallback retrieve such that:

it is clear that the transformations done on retrieved content that it
is decided by the container
the transformations which the container should never do


Change the URICallback API so that retrieval or rewriting is done
at the same time as the decision is taken.
URL and mimetype may not be sufficient for a container to decide
whether or not to retrieve and whether to cajole the retrieved content
because the context it is used in is not completely captured by the
mimetype.  Possible contexts include:

img
script
raw bytes (for example when a JSON object is retrieved but not evaled)


A container should never retrieve and cajole a script because the
cajoled output will be inlined into an already cajoled script --
something which will probably not work correctly.
