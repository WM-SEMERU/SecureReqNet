[Validator] UrlValidator and UTF8-NFD


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4+ (have not tested older versions)
Description
It looks like the UrlValidator has issues with UTF-8-NFD encoded urls/filesnames. This encoding is used on macs and and when validating urls with umlauts in it's filesname, which have ben generated on macs, the validator will fail.
In my example it validates
https://example.com/köchin.html
fine, but not
https://example.com/köchin.html
With UTF-8-NFD umlauts are saved as basicly two characters and not as a single one, like in the normal UTF-8.
How to reproduce
Here is an example with the symfony url validator regex:

Leave only the first url and it will match, delete the first and leave the second will not match.
