Add RUNTIME_REQUEST_TIMEOUT to local-up-cluster.sh


The changes to local-cluster-up.sh from #75662 is causing the
CRI-O CI to break since it picks up the --runtime-request-timeout
flag as part of the container-runtime-endpoint flag.
Adding a new env so that we can set the runtime-request-timeout
value for our CI.
