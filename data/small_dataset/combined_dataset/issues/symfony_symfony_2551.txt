[Security] AdvancedUserInterface change


I would like to propose a change to the Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\AdvancedUserInterface. In my opinion the current method names are not really to the point. I propose a change for the methods from isNotXxx to isXxx for shorter and more obvious method names.
If there are no arguments against this, I'd be happy to open a pull request for this.
proposed interface:
<?php
namespace Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User;
interface AdvancedUserInterface extends UserInterface
{
    function isAccountExpired();
    function isAccountLocked();
    function isCredentialsExpired();
    function isDisabled();
}
