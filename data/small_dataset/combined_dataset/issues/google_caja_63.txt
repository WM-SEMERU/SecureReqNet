Implement plugin_dispatchEvent___ to properly gate form submission


Original issue 63 created by mikesamuel on 2008-02-02T03:41:11.000Z:
Our event dispatch method needs to clone the event and push processing back
onto the event queue to overcome the attack detailed at
http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/wiki/EventChecksCircumventableByInfLoops
We should also change the form action to something innocuous such as
about:blank so that we can reset form submission to only work when
submitted via javascript.
