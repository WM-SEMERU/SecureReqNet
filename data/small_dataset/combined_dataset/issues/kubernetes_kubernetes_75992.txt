fixed timeout handler to correctly log 500 errors


What type of PR is this?
/kind bug
/priority important-longterm
/sig api-machinery
/cc cheftako
What this PR does / why we need it:
Currently if a request has a serialization error (eg: tcp broken pipe, etc.) and is interpreted as a 500 by the apiserver, the apiserver incorrectly logs a 200.  This happens due to a bug in the timeout handler which incorrectly masks the 500 with a 200 as it believes the 500 was already written out.
Which issue(s) this PR fixes:
Fixes #75983
Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
NONE
