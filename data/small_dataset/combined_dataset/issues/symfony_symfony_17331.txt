[Security] Voter with AccessDecisionManager & isGranted calls


Hello,
I created a voter following the documentation, injecting the AccessDecisionManager to check the current token roles as in the "checking for roles inside a voter" section.
However, when calling is_granted from a Twig Template (or isGranted from a controller), I get a circular dependency issue on security.access.decision_manager.
This seems logical as the process is in the form of: twig -> security.authorization_checker (is_granted) -> security.access.decision_manager (decide) -> Voter -> security.access.decision_manager (decide).
I thought about:

creating a service (MyEntityEvaluator) using function compilers (tagging with security.expressions.function_evaluator) as expressions
creating Twig Functions in a Twig_Extension mapping to a service (MyEntityEvaluator).
passing the container in the service, getting the decision_manager, and call the isGranted method

Am I missing something?
Thanks for your time
