- Effort: Low
- Impact: Info
- Location: Markdown

#### Details

It was found that the Markdown sanitizer allows to create HTML `<img>` elements that are applied with a `name` attribute. The `name` attribute can be used to "clobber" existing native properties and methods on the document DOM object. As a result, an image can for example overwrite the method `document.getElementById()` with the image itself and cause the website to fail as this method is needed by various libraries and JS features.

The following HTML will "clobber" the methods `document.getElementById()` and `document.getElementsByTagName()`:

```
<img name="getElementById" src="">
<img name="getElementsByTagName" src="">
```

Once this MD has been submitted, the Gitlab website will start throwing JavaScript errors.

```

function[Learn More]  common.a208e8b828f4e7f4759b.bundle.js:1:22116
```

While no exploitable issue has yet been found, it is recommended to mitigate the issue nevertheless.

#### Reproduction Steps

- Create an MD file in any repository
- Add the HTML above and open the file 
- Observe the website throw JavaScript errors

Please note that, if e.g. the KaTeX rendering plugin is used, it will not work anymore.

#### Recommendation

The `name` attribute should not be allowed for any HTML element.
