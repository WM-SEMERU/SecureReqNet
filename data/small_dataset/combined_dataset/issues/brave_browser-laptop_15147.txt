Completely broken bookmarks manager


Description
After deleting a folder and importing again from Chrome there is a "ghost disabled" bookmark on the toolbar and the bookmark manager is completely off not showing any bookmarks.
Steps to Reproduce

Import from Chrome
Delete a folder
Re-import from Chrome

Brave Version
0.23.105
Additional Information
The folder I deleted before the problem appeared was an imported folder. I moved it (because drag n drop is broken too for bookmark folders on Toolbar) and it went in two places. I deleted the first one and then I got at the toolbar an undeletable disabled bookmark icon that I guess breaks the bookmark manager completely.
