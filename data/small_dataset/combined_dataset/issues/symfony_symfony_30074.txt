Currently using the XliffFileDumper for exporting messages from catalogue with domain of the form xxxx+intl-icu produces an invalid Xliff version 2.0 file as the file id attribute is of type xs:NMTOKEN (cf. https://github.com/symfony/translation/blob/master/Resources/schemas/xliff-core-2.0.xsd#L139) which doesn't accept + character (cf. http://www.datypic.com/sc/xsd/t-xsd_NMTOKEN.html).
Exception is thrown when loading the content after.
