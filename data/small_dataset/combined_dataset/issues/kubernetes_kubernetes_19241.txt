Extract keygen image


The mesos/docker cluster uses a docker image to generate rsa keys, ssl root authorities, and ssl certificates. I've extracted this docker image to its own repo.
This is part of an effort to make the mesos/docker cluster scripts more maintainable and abstract, to enable extraction of a similar non-mesos docker cluster.
Changes:

Move keygen image mesosphere/kubernetes-mesos-keygen -> mesosphere/kubernetes-keygen:v1.0.0
Remove resolveip in favor of github.com/karlkfi/resolveip (resolveip.sh)
Remove util-temp-dir.sh in favor of github.com/karlkfi/intemp (intemp.sh)
Refactor bash code to use intemp (extract functions to scripts)
Remove util-ssl.sh in favor of mesosphere/kubernetes-keygen
