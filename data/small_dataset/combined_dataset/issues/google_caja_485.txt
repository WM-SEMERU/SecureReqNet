Forms with no action attribute don't use the proxy


Original issue 485 created by collin.jackson on 2008-06-11T00:40:26.000Z:
What steps will reproduce the problem?
<form onsubmit=""><input type="submit"</form>
What is the expected output?
Form with button that does nothing when you click it (or uses the proxy)
What do you see instead?
Form with button that submits to the current page when you click it
What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Caja Test Bed
Please provide any additional information below.
I think the intent of elementPolicies.form is to cancel submissions of
forms that have no action attribute.
