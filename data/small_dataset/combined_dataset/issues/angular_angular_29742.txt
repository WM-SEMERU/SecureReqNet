Expected vs Actual Behavior**
There is nothing specific to v7 about the command below. Also, this page shouldn't have anything version-specific in it.
Recommend: "Perform a basic update to the most current stable release of the CLI and the core framework by running the following command."
Note: I'm not sure how to phrase it, but this command won't update to a beta or RC. Only the most current generally-available release (but Angular project doesn't use the term "GA"). Maybe the most current stable release?
