Weakness:      Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Details:
There's an IDOR vulnerability in the `lib/api/todos.rb` (`/api/v4/todos/:id/mark_as_done`) endpoint that allows an unauthorized person to see every Todo object on a GitLab instance. Since the Todo serializer returns the project, merge requests, milestones, it's easy to enumerate over the Todo objects and extract confidential information. To reproduce, follow these steps:

 - sign in as a normal user
 - create a personal access token
 - execute the following cURL command (replace the private token and `:id`):

**Request**
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Private-Token: xxxxxxxxxxxxx' https://gitlab.com/api/v4/todos/:id/mark_as_done
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "id": 224445,
  "project": {
    "id": 303127,
    "description": "",
    "name": "proj4me-web",
    "name_with_namespace": "vocegerente / proj4me-web",
    "path": "web",
    "path_with_namespace": "proj4me/web",
    "created_at": "2015-06-07T15:47:25.464Z",
    ...
}
```

Even though the endpoint is intended to mark the Todo object as done, it won't actually update it. This is caused by the `TodoService` class that is constrained to only the user's own todos. Here's the vulnerable piece of code:

**lib/api/todos.rb**
```ruby
post ':id/mark_as_done' do
  TodoService.new.mark_todos_as_done_by_ids(params[:id], current_user)
  todo = Todo.find(params[:id])

  present todo, with: Entities::Todo, current_user: current_user
end
```

The `TodoService` will not throw an error when an `id` is passed that doesn't belong to the user. After that, the `find` call with simply fetch the object again (essentially reloading the data) and pass it along to the presenter. There's no authorization check in place, allowing an attacker to see the confidential information.

This has been tested against the latest version of GitLab CE and EE.

## Impact

An attacker can gain access to private merge requests (including their description), projects, milestones, and todos. This may reveal sensitive information.
