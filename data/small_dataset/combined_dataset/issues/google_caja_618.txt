readImport should probably read only own properties of the imports object


Original issue 618 created by erights on 2008-06-16T14:13:15.000Z:
<script type="text/javascript">
toString;
</script>
correctly cajoles to
<script type="text/javascript">{
_.loadModule(function (, IMPORTS__) {
{
var toString = _.readImport(IMPORTS, 'toString');
IMPORTS__ 'yield' ;
}
});
}</script>
which evaluates to an attached method. This is presumably the
Object.prototype.toString method as attached to the IMPORTS___ object.
This is currently harmless, but is quite surprising.
