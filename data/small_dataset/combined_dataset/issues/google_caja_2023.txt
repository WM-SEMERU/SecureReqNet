Fix CSS declaration skip after extra semicolon


Fixes #1993
This issue happens because declaration() is called with a token list such as
[";", "margin", ":", "auto"]
The token ; is recognized as an invalid identifier, and the parser advances the token stream until the next semicolon (or closing brace).
With this patch, the parser will advance a single token when meeting either whitespace or a semicolon, thus fixing the issue.
Alternative patches that may be considered:

Checking the previous token in skipDeclaration() ?
