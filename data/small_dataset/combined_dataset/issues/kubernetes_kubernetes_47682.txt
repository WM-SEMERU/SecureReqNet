Echoserver:1.4 triggers XSS warnings


The ingress tests use an echoserver version that echoes URLs directly, so requesting /<script>alert('oops')</script> will put a script tag in the output. The output is Content-Type text/plain, but some browsers (IE) perform content-sniffing that may cause the script to execute.
This means test runs can get flagged by automated XSS scanners, despite an XSS against echoserver being useless.
