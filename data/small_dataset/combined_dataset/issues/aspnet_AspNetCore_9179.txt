Razor Components feature request: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputPassword


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I am trying to use Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputText with type="password".  As far as I can tell though there is no way to add type="password"
Describe the solution you'd like

Allow specifying type in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputText

or

Add a  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputPassword class

Describe alternatives you've considered
For now I plan to just extend Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputText and add type="password".  But this seems like something a lot of apps would need, so it'd be nice to put it in the standard library.
Other info
Currently using .NET Core 3.0 Preview 3
