Removing the state handling from the AuthService
Reload the page on logout event or an 401 response (to be sure that all the data wiped out)
Show timeout notification on 403 response
There is a fix for the dropdown buttons to use unique IDs in order to be able to work multiple instances on the same page.
Changing the login form in order to use auth messages instead of the single "not authorised one"
Changing the notification titles optional
Changing some private properties to public to prepare the templates to upgrade
Some small formatting changes where I touched a file.
