net/url: Parse accepts invalid userinfo strings


@adamdecaf reported that net/url.Parse accepts URLs with userinfo components containing just about anything (newlines and random non-ASCII Unicode).
This could be a security problem if people use the resulting URL.User.Username & Password without further validation.
