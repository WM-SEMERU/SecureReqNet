JwtRegisteredClaimNames invalid references to RFC7519


Describe the bug
Invalid JwtRegisteredClaimNames and invalid references to RFC7519 standard documentation.
I wanted to use actor claim validation but it was failing since I implemented OAuth Token Exchange Draft
I traced this a while, and found out that logic was different so had to implement my own case.
But while tracing I found many claim types pointing to RFC7519 standard - Section 4
( RFC7519 Section 4 )
, but they don't exist there.
To Reproduce
Open JwtRegisteredClaimNames (Go To Definition) class in IDE or editor of choice and
compare to RFC7519 Section 4
You will see wrong references and non existing claim types that refer to RFC7519 Section 4.
Expected behavior
To be in sync with standard
