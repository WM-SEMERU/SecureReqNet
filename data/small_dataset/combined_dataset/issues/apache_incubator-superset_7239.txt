Group Dashboards  folders or tags


Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!

 I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
 I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
 I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.

Superset version
"0.26.3"
Expected results
Can "Group Dashboards  folders or tags"
Actual results
Cannot group Dashboards by folders or tags
Steps to reproduce
We have too much dashboards, we want to group dashboards by purposes  by create folders or tags. Then it will help us easy to manage
Can you suggest the ways to do it?
