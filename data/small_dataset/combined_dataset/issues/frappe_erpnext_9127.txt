File/Attachment Permissions Security Role


Linked with - #9102 - and - #9116 - would like to see a new permissions role added to role permissions manager for documents.
See - https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/default-file-setting-to-private/23698/8 - for more information as well.
The premise is to give more security options to attachments that are placed on various document types.  For example on the item document type, when you place a product image on there the admin could set that to public automatically. However for more sensitive documents, such as an employee document, attachments might be at a higher permissions level - say a 1 - so that an HR Manager role would be the one to see those attachments along with any other sensitive data fields. That way you could open up the employee database to a bigger audience and allow your employees to see more employee data (with employee role), but give that granular security to attachments.
Lots of use cases for this. Please consider it.
