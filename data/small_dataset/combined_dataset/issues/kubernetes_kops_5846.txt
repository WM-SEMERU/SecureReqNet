Calico CNI: Update Calico/CalicoNetworkingSpec to allow different backends


https://github.com/spotinst/kubernetes-kops.git
We can now specify the state store for calico and there is an option to use the k8s API instead of etcd. We should at least document and support this mode, but we should consider migrating the default calico configuration as well.
This is a bit more involved than just changing a couple of arguments in the manifest, but theoretically should be fairly straight forward. We'd need to add an additional field to the CalicoNetworkingSpec



kops/pkg/apis/kops/networking.go


         Line 72
      in
      21f9754






 // CalicoNetworkingSpec declares that we want Calico networking 





And we'd need to either support changing the backend (to and from etcd) ideally in an automated fashion, or have some pretty solid documentation as an intermediate stepr.
