Suggest packages on missing autowiring aliases


When I use a type-hint for an interface that is not installed, autowiring fails with a generic message, e.g.: Cannot autowire argument $client of "App\Controller\HelloController::index()": argument "$responseFactory" of method "Symfony\Component\HttpClient\Psr18Client::__construct()" has type "Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface" but this class was not found.
But in this example, we could suggest a solution: compose require nyholm/psr7 will install recipes for the interface. Maybe we could display this as a suggestion when we detect that flex is installed? We would do this for packages with official recipes only to reduce the scope.
Another example is  Cannot determine controller argument for "App\Controller\HelloController::index()": the $client argument is type-hinted with the non-existent class or interface: "Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface". when psr/http-client is missing.
