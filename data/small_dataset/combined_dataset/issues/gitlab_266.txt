I can't clone or push via SSH after upgrading CE to 6.8.1 and shell to 1.9.3  I have SSH Key setup as before and rake task don't show any errors for GitLab, GitLab-Shell, or SSH.

Current error reads:

    ssh: connect to host domain.example port 22: Bad file number
    fatal: Cloud not read from remote repository.
    Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
