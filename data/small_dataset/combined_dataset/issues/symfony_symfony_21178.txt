This PR is a way to be able to use a specific strategy (in the AccessDecisionManager) for particular attributes / object / token. Cf #15130 for more discussion about this.
I know the idea in the issue was rejected but this implementation is different and time have passed since then, so maybe there will be a new look on this.
