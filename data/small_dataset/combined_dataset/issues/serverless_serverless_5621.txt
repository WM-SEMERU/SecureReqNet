Ensure AWS S3 buckets created by Serverless can't be accessed over HTTP


This is a Feature Proposal
Description
At a recent security audit I had done on some infrastructure, several of the S3 buckets created by the Serverless Framework showed up as not having SecureTransport flag set to true as part of the Bucket Policy.
While the buckets aren't created public, it's also (maybe?) a relatively simple change to enforce the policy.
The security team provided an example policy to apply to each newly created (or existing) bucket:
{
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Effect":"Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::<bucketname>/*",
            "Condition":{
                "Bool":
                { "aws:SecureTransport": false }
            }
        }
    ]
}
