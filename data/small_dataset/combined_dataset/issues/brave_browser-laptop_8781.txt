block webgl2 fingerprinting and webgl readPixels


fix #8448
Test Plan:

go to https://browserleaks.com/webgl and turn on fingerprinting protection
the report hash should be '0C21A6FA2A9BD79DFF6E128FE55094B4'
the image hash should be empty
all the fields under the triangle image should be empty


 Submitted a ticket for my issue if one did not already exist.
 Used Github auto-closing keywords in the commit message.
 Added/updated tests for this change (for new code or code which already has tests).
 Ran git rebase -i to squash commits (if needed).
