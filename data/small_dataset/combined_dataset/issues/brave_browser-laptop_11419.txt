Backing up wallet to file creates recovery file in AppData


Testplan
see #13279

Description
The brave_wallet_recovery.txt file is stored in %appdata%\brave\ before offering it for saving.
The file's content contains this sentence "Save this key in a safe place, separate from your Brave browser.", so Brave acts against its own advice by saving this file in the profile.
Steps to Reproduce

Go to about:preferences#payments
Click the cogwheel
Click 'Back up your wallet'
Click 'Save recovery file...'

Actual result:
The file being stored in %appdata%\brave\ as well as the location specified by the user.
Expected result:
The file only being stored in the location indicated by the user.
Reproduces how often:
Each time.

Additional Information
Technically, all information to get the wallet would already be available in %appdata%\brave\, but having the recovery file there seems a bit overdoing it.
