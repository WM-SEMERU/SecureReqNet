Update "How to Authenticate Users with API Keys"


While reading How to Authenticate Users with API Keys cookbook few ideas just came into my mind.
Is there any reason why this cookbook suggests to [manually] inject custom user provider (ApiKeyUserProvider) into authenticator service (ApiKeyAuthenticator)? Using this solution I see two minor issues that can be solved another way. First, we need to inject another service... Second, $userProvider argument of ApiKeyAuthenticator :: authenticateToken() method is left unused.
If I'm right, we can achieve the same goal by eliminating injection and additiong few lines to security.yml:
security:
    providers:
        # ...
        api_key_user_provider: # This on is already registered, but not used
            id: api_key_user_provider
    firewalls:
        secured_area:
            pattern: ^/admin
            stateless: false
            simple_preauth:
                authenticator: apikey_authenticator
            provider: api_key_user_provider # Shouldn't we set provider here instead of injecting it?
If we inject ApiKeyUserProvider manually, then there is no reason to register it as provider or even implement UserProviderInterface.
What do you think?

Also in few places ApiKeyAuthentication should be renamed to ApiKeyAuthenticator.
