Update audit events with additional fields.


This pull request makes sure that each audit event emitted by the system has these additional common fields like described in gravitational/gravity.e#4031:

The code field contains a unique code for each event type in the format described in the above ticket.
The severity field contains event severity.
The message field contains user-friendly short event description.

I have also implemented it in a way so it's easy for Gravity (or anything else, e.g. enterprise Teleport if needed) to inject its own event types.
