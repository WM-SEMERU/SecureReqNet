Webtorrent file doesn't stream when file name is clicked on


Description
Instead of streaming the torrent content in window when clicking on the file name, Brave instead offers to save the file to your device:

When torrent is opened in a new tab (from webtorrent screen), stream content opens in the new tab and will play as intended.
Steps to Reproduce

Ensure Brave webtorrent ext is enabled in settings
Start torrent file in webtorrent
Click on torrent name

Actual result:
(see above gif)
Expected result:
Clicking the file name should start streaming content in new tab rather than offer to download file.
Reproduces how often:
Easily
Brave version (brave://version info)
v0.61.52
Reproducible on current release:

Does it reproduce on brave-browser dev/beta builds?
Yes

Additional Information
FWIW, there should be a "play" or "start stream" button here instead of clicking on the file name -- Its not very clear nor is it stated anywhere that this is how to initiate video playback.
