Use Snyk in place of nsp to test for known security vulnerabilities


Describe the problem and steps to reproduce it:
When a known security vulnerability in one of our dependencies is disclosed, we want our tests to fail so we can apply the patch or ignore the advisory.
What happened?
We already use nsp for this but it doesn't catch all advisories.
What did you expect to happen?
We should catch as many advisories as possible. Let's try switching to Snyk because it reports more advisories.
Anything else we should know?
