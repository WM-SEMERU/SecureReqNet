We have a custom RuboCop cop to disallow the use of `public_send`. This also checks specs, even though specs aren't included in Omnibus at all. Using `public_send` is often useful in specs to parameterise testing several methods with the same conditions. Of course, it's not a huge deal to add a line comment disabling the cop, but maybe we could just disable it in specs completely?
