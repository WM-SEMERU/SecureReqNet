Give HTTP a scarier (more obvious) icon


Did you search for similar issues before submitting this one?
yes
Describe the issue you encountered:
The icon for regular HTTP in the url bar was recently changed from blue to gray with the following: #2160
If users are visiting a site using HTTP, it would be great if it was painfully obvious they are not on a secure site (even if https everywhere is used behind the scenes).
Expected behavior:
The icon should not be a lock. I personally believe change is too subtle for many folks to notice. The gray helps for sure, but it would be better to see a different icon.
Here's an example with an icon I think is appropriate:

two good candidates I saw are:
fa-exclamation-triangle (pictured)
fa-times-circle
