[WIP DO NOT MERGE] Add local ISO upload via UI


Description
Problem: Users can register ISOs from URL but cannot upload local ISOs.
Root cause: CloudStack provides browser-based upload support for volumes and templates, but ISOs are not supported.
Solution:
The existing browser-based upload from local functionality for templates and volumes (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=39620237) is extended to support uploading local ISOs.

Extend the UI: A new button is created under the ISOs view: 'Upload from Local'. A new dialog form is displayed in which the user must select the ISO to upload from its local file system.
Extend the API: New 'GetUploadParamsForIso' API command is created to handle the ISO upload.
