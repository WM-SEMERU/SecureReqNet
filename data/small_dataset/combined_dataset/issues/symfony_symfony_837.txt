[2.1] AuthenticationException enhancements


There are two enhancements which could be made to the AuthenticationException:

add a getMessageKey(), getMessageData() which could be used by the translation component as the exception message itself cannot be safely displayed to the user
change the signature of the constructor to match that of \Exception and pass $extraInformation via a setter

@lsmith77, do you still plan to work on this?
