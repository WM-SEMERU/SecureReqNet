Brave doesn't appear on Windows Start menu


I did a search via a popular search engine but cannot find this issue. There are seemingly related issues such as #6484 and #2061. I learnt from #2061 that Brave installs into %userprofile%\AppData\Local. Otherwise, as a normal user, I wouldn't had been able to know where to launch Brave.
When installing Brave via BraveSetup-x64.exe downloaded from the Brave website, the completed installation launches Brave immediately. This is fine. However, Brave does not appear on the Start menu. A normal user would not be able to re-launch Brave if it isn't set as default after the first launch. I had to create a start menu shortcut manually (it still doesn't appear on the application list).
Steps to Reproduce

Install Brave
Browser through Start menu applications

Actual result:

Expected result:
That Brave will appear on the list on the left, instead of having to create a shortcut manually in the section on the right.
