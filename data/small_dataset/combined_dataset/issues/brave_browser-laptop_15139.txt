Toggling 'Show only included sites' removes a couple of pinned sites from the top of Payments


Have you searched for similar issues? Yes
Description
I think the titles best describes the issue. The only extra thing I can add is that the two that go away that have been pinned have a slight shade or transparency to them. It's not like the rest where you have grey, light grey, grey down the list of Sites. This has the text shaded as well.
Steps to Reproduce
I wouldn't know how, I only noticed it in the recent update.
Actual result: I'd include a screenshot if it's essential but setting percentages is causing another issue for this to be presented.
Expected result: Sites should remain where they are when 'Show only included sites' is toggled especially when they are pinned. Technically nothing pinned should ever be removed from the top, right?
