ESLint-scope 3.7.2 has been hacked


Please see the following issue:
eslint/eslint-scope#39
eslint-scope 3.7.2 has been published an hour ago which is a hacked version that steals the NPM accounts or something.
Please pull the version 3.7.2 from the npm and freeze the account so this does not get propagated.
As a matter of fact, there is no release tag for 3.7.2 on Github, so I think it would be great to consider double checking with Github repository before publishing any code.
This would at least limit the possibility of uploading the malicious code to NPM without having Github credentials to tag the release/version.
Additionally I believe it's possible to check if the release was signed and somehow enforce all tagged commits to be signed. I think Github returns such information via their API, at least you can see the verified commits via Github's web interface so there must be a way. Developer may be able to opt-in for this extra security via some .rc file stored in Git repo.
