This adds a new optional interface that receivers should implement to give an approximate number of the messages "waiting" to be handled. Why? Because, with this, you could design a system that dynamically adds/removes worker processes if a specific transport is getting slammed and needs help. Creating that system could be something we discuss for core later, but this at least makes it possible - and means it could be implemented by the user or in a bundle... which I might do if we don't get it in core ;).
