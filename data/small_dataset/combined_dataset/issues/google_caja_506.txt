Consider separating rewriting from validation in Cajoler


Original issue 506 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-11T19:03:43.000Z:
Some pipeline stages in the Cajoler (e.g., SanitizeHTMLStage,
ValidateCSSStage) mix both rewriting (transformation/normalization/other
kinds of nontrivial modification to tree) and validation (yes/no checking
that the tree is "safe" or otherwise OK, possibly combined with removing
entire subtrees that are not safe/OK).  It's not clear to me whether this
is a good architectural decision.
Points to consider: It might be easier to do security review if these are
clearly separated.  It might eliminate some maintenance hazards: changes to
the rewriting/normalization/transformation are less likely to introduce
security breaches that allow one to write unsafe HTML/CSS.  It might reduce
the likelihood of mutation-related bugs, where you validate some HTML/CSS
parse tree and then the tree gets mutated afterwards (e.g., by
transformation).  On the other hand, this might cause code blowup or
duplication.
