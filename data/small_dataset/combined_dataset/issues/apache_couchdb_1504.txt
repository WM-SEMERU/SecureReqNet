Redesign CouchDB security system


@janl:


closed by default
more fine-grained permissions
more options for delegated authentication

Our security system is slowly grown and not coherently designed. We should start over. I have many ideas and opinions, but they are out of scope for this. I think everybody here agrees that we can do better. This very likely will not include per-document ACLs as per the often stated issues with that approach in our data model.

@davisp:

Big +1 on this. The auth stuff in our code base is hard to follow and difficult to hold in my brain. Taking a step back to redesign from the ground up would be super awesome.
