[Security] [Bug] AuthenticationManager is never run by AnonymousAuthenticationListener


AnonymousAuthenticationProvider contains authenticate method that verifies wether populated AnonymousToken has the same key as current firewall, which is correct but never run.
To fix that we need in method AnonymousAuthenticationListener::handle add call to AuthenticationManager::authenticate and catch Exception that method may throw.
I've got a fix already and could send a PR if you think that's the right approach.
