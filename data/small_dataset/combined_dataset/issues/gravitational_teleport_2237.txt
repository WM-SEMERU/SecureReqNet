Remove the need to pre-distribute auth API certificates


Description
Currently to avoid MITM-attack when adding new nodes to a cluster, a user must export the cluster's auth API HTTPS certificate via tctl auth export --type=tls and save it into /var/lib/teleport/ca.cert on every node, see this
Problem
It's annoying and inconvenient.
Proposal
@klizhentas has developed a plan to avoid doing this. It's based on changing the way how invitation tokens are generated:

The auth server computes a secure hash of it's private key and uses it as a prefix for an invitation token.
The new node, prior to offering its join token, requests the hash from the auth server.
Node decides to trust the auth server only if the hash matches what's in the token

Questions
How would this work with static tokens?
