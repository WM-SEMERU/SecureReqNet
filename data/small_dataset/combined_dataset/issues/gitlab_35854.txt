'### Description

Originally discussed at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33281#note_36484896 while we were working on [Protected runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33281).

Comments from @markpundsack 

> Should we also protect Container Registry? If user doesn't have a permission on the protected branch, the user should not be able to pull the image. This would be useful when using docker executor.

@dosuken123 That's a really interesting questions. It's not really about being able to pull images as that's not generally the problem, but someone could push to an image (that otherwise would have been generated from a protected branch) using their regular login. Please create a separate issue to discuss. I'm not aware of anyone asking for this restriction, but maybe it just hasn't come up yet.
