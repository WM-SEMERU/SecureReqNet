Add context map to AuthenticationResult


Adds a String->Object map to AuthenticationResult, for Authenticator/Authorizer combinations that require storing more information about the request than just an identity string.
This PR also removes the JSON property annotations from AuthenticationResult, since it shouldn't need to be serialized/deserialized.
