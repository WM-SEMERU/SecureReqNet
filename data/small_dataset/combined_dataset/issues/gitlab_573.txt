Hello!

First of all, thanks for GitLab, it is verry great :)
I have a small problem with the diff file with several files. A screenshot says everything 

![1](https://gitlab.com/uploads/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/9fd78d59df/1.png)

As you can see, the line 91 is displayed 3 lines above the correct line. If you look at the HTML file 

![124](https://gitlab.com/uploads/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/720a528ad0/124.png)

You can see that the line as 3 lines above the correct line.

Thanks :)
