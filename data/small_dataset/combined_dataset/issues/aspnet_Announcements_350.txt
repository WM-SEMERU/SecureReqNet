For contributors: moved ASP.NET 4.x docs to new GitHub repo


In an effort to reduce the GitHub repo size and to reduce docset build times, the ASP.NET 4.x product documentation has migrated from the aspnet/Docs repo to the aspnet/AspNetDocs repo.
To continue making contributions to ASP.NET 4.x documentation, create a local clone of the aspnet/AspNetDocs repo. To continue making contributions to ASP.NET Core documentation, please refresh your local clone.
In the near future, the team plans to rewrite the commit history in aspnet/Docs. We realize this is an extreme step, but we feel it's worth doing to reduce the repo size by ~70%. At that point, contributors will need to reclone aspnet/Docs. Look for another announcement when that change occurs.
