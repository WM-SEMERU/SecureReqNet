I've created a test repo in my own namespace called "test" and when I try to rename it to "test123" under "Dangerous Settings -> Rename repository -> Path" then I got an redirect error because GitLab tries to redirect to the old path name:

http://mygitlab.domain.com/myusername/test

instead of

http://mygitlab.domain.com/myusername/test123

I've also noticed that the repo under "/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/myuser/" is still named "test.git" and not "test123.git".

This makes the "Rename repository" option unusable!!!
