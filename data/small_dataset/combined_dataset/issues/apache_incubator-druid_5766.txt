Fix KerberosAuthenticator serverPrincipal host replacement


The Kerberos authenticator has a feature to replace the "_HOST" placeholder string (if present) in the serverPrincipal with the value of druid.host.
This transformation wasn't applied in getPrincipalFromRequestNew(), this patch changes serverPrincipal such that the host replacement is applied in the constructor and saved.
