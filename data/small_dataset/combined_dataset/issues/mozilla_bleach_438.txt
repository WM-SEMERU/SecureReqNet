Unvendor the html5lib library


html5lib development has stabilized in recent months. So concerns of frequent API breakage is less than it was in the past.
Reduces the need for users to have html5lib installed multiple times: once by itself and once by Bleach. setup.py now uses a version specifier to ensure a compatible version is installed.
Unvendoring is more secure. Should the html5lib library discover and fix a security issue, library users can update html5lib -- and only html5lib -- to incorporate the fix across their project. In Bleach's current
state, Bleach will immediately need to make a release to include such a security fix. This creates unnecessary additional attack vectors.
