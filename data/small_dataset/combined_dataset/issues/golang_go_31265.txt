cmd/compile: intrinsify math/bits.RotateLeft{32,64} on all architectures


#21536 (comment) reminded me about this. Currently the intrinsic is only implemented on amd64, arm64, ppc64 and s390x. We should enable it everywhere. It will need tests in tests/codegen. Could be a good beginner compiler issue to tackle.
CLs so far:

amd64: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/132435
arm64: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/122542
ppc64: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/163760
s390x: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/133035
