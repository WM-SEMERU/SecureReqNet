Support @async for script-inserted scripts


Original issue 1855 created by bruant.d on 2013-09-05T14:56:45.000Z:
This obviously changes the semantics. I haven't looked at the @async attribute, but I fear the same thing happens.
For @defer and @async, you can look at the HTML5 spec (for the bravest) or look at this page: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/script-execution/
