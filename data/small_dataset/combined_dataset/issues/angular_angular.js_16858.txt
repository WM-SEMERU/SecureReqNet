angular-animate can't handle localization bug in chrome / animation very slow



issue caused by an old browser version (chromium 59, used by cypress e2e testing tool, thats how I hit it)
angular.js 1.7.8

Issue: angular-animate + this chromium bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=720222
This is the problem:

What you see in the image: I'm in locale de_DE, and this chromium version 59 formats the computed style localized. So the fraction seperator is a , instead of a ..
How it manifests in angular-animate (see parseMaxTime method):

parseMaxTime('0.35s') returns durationTime: 0.35 <- normal behavior
parseMaxTime('0,35s') returns durationTime: 35 <- this browser

So you expect an animation to last 0.35s, but instead it animates for 35s
Had this issues with angular-ui-bootstrap accordion / collapsible css class .collapsing that by default is transitionDuration: 0.35s
