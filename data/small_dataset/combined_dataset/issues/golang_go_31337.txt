What operating system and processor architecture are you using (go env)?
go env Output$ go env
set GOARCH=amd64
set GOBIN=
set GOCACHE=C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\go-build
set GOEXE=.exe
set GOFLAGS=
set GOHOSTARCH=amd64
set GOHOSTOS=windows
set GOOS=windows
set GOPATH=C:\code\gopath

What did you do?
Create an RPC client and server, start the server first, then start the client, and then restart the server, the client's RPC client will appear "connection is shut down" error, just a string. I need to determine if the connection is disconnected, but I can't get the'shutdown'field in Client.
What did you expect to see?
