AspNetCore.WsFederation get signin-wsfed redirect to HTTP when original request is HTTPS


Describe the bug
An aspnetcore 2.1 website hosted in a Docker container on port HTTP, along with the use of an nginx reverse proxy exposing HTTPS 443 only.
The website is accessed from the outside on HTTPS, it redirects to an STS website on HTTPS, which redirects to the /signin-wsfed on HTTPS.
However, the response location from the /signin-wsfed is HTTP.
Expected behavior
The response location is preserved as HTTPS, considering the request POST URL is.
Additional context
Here is the request:
POST https://core-mydocker.####/signin-wsfed HTTP/1.1
Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-application, application/xaml+xml, application/x-ms-xbap, */*

and the response:

HTTP being inacessible from the outside, this provokes an error.
Note: Tested as well on aspnetcore 2.2.2, same issue.
