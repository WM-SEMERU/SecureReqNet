[hackerone] webkitRelativePath may expose OS username


https://hackerone.com/reports/258585
It appears that webkitRelativePath in Brave may expose the username, whereas in Chrome it doesn't. I'm not 100% sure it won't also expose the OS username in Chrome if the home folder itself is your default file picker location. However, it is weird that Brave shows the parent folder of the selected folder + selected folder, whereas Chrome shows selected folder + filename of first file. demo: https://dev.ruby.sh/brave/trap.html
STR:

copy this to a local html file:

<h3 id="qmsg"></h3>
<input id="thing" type="file" webkitdirectory mozdirectory  />
<script>
    thing.onchange = function() {
       qmsg.innerHTML = thing.files[0].webkitRelativePath;
    }
</script>


start a local webserver and open the file above
click the 'choose files' button. select the same folder in both Chrome and Brave
notice that the result is different in Chrome and Brave
