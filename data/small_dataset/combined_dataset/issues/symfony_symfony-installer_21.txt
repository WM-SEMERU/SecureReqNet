Check downloaded file integrity


Now, the Symfony installer downloads the compressed file from http://symfony.com/download?v=Symfony_Standard_Vendors.x.x.x.zip. As it is not using https, it would be safer if the installer could check the integrity of the downloaded file to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. I am not sure if it is the best approach, but here goes my proposal:

With each compressed file, provide a separate file (e.g. Symfony_Standard_Vendors_2.5.5.key) with the hash of the file (e.g. hash256). That file should be signed using the symfony.com private key.
In the installer, once the file has been downloaded and before doing any other operation, download the *.key file and decrypt it using the symfony.com public key. The public key would be included in the installer.
Check the integrity of the downloaded file (hashes are the same).

I know Composer is doing something similar, it would be nice to get some feedback.
