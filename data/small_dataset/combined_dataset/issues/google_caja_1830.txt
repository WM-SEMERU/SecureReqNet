Need to stop calling WeakMap as a function


Original issue 1832 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-08-06T21:28:33.000Z:
ES6 is expected to require 'new WeakMap()' rather than 'WeakMap()'. This restriction is already in Chrome Canary.

We should:

Remove all occurrences of 'WeakMap()' from our own code. To support this, I propose making it a warning if our emulated WeakMap is so invoked.
Stop exposing a WeakMap emulation which permits this, so that autoswitching doesn't break things. I propose making it an error some time after making it a warning.
