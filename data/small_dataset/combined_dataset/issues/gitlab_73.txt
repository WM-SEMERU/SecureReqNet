The graphs look like as if they draw a BÃ©zier curve on the counted commits per day, which is completely wrong. My tiny project therefore looks as if there has been a permanent activity in the past months though I have only worked on it in november and february. There wasn't a single commit in december and january.

So I guess the graphs are created directly from the commit dates rather than to count the number of commits for each and every day shown in the graph and provide a count of zero for each day without any commit.

This way the graphics make a false assumption about the nature of the data git provides. You are only allowed to draw a line between two measuring points if you can assume, that between those points is still some activity which you do not measure. The line is then your assumption on how this data could look like, if you would have measured them. So if, for example, you measure the temperature every hour and you draw a straight line between those measuring points you make the assumption that there is a temperature in each and every second and that it develops linear from one measuring point to the next. This might not be quite the truth but it is a good approximation if the measuring points are close, which means you measure often enough.

But the data, that git provides, are complete. And they are not continous like a temperature. So there are no other data to make assuptions upon and in theory there are no lines allowed at all between the days with activity. Second those data are not values on a scale but the accumulation of commits (count) per time span.

If you want still provide such a graphic on a day by day basis, you have at least to provide the days without a commit as measuring points with a number of zero commits.

But I think a vertical bar graph with a bar for each and every day fits much better the nature of the data than a line graph.
