Fix elb tagging


Turns out we weren't tagging quite right, also needed to add a removal function.
To note, this also adds a new tag to existing elbs since we're now using b.Cluster.Spec.CloudLabels to generate the elb tags:
"kubernetes.io/cluster/clustername.example.com" = "owned"

I don't believe this should have any negative effects.
Fixes: #6646, #2048
Since this was included in 1.12 and has some weird effects, I think we should cherry-pick it in.
