[HttpClient] Setting both json and body shouldn't be allowed


Setting both body and json in the HttpOptions is allowed, but it will result in having the json encoded data set in 'body'. See 


symfony/src/Symfony/Component/HttpClient/HttpClientTrait.php


         Line 44
      in
      37b616f






  $options['body'] = self::jsonEncode($options['json']); 





I think an exception should be thrown when having this options both set. That might improve DX.
I'm happy to provide a PR. What exception should be thrown?
