Remove unnecessary map in cleanupHistory


What type of PR is this?
/kind cleanup
What this PR does / why we need it:
In cleanupHistory, we iterate over old ControllerRevision's to mark live history.
This loop and the corresponding map is not needed since we iterate over old ControllerRevision's one more time later in the same method.
We can check hash against liveHashes in the subsequent loop to achieve the same result.
NONE
