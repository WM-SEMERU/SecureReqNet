### Summary

When a comment on an issue contains a HTML script-tag it gets executed on save when editing that comment.

### Steps to reproduce

* Leave a comment containing `<script>alert("foo");</script>`. You may even put it in backtick-quotes, it won't change the outcome.
* Save the comment.
* Click on the edit icon.
* Save again -> Your browser should alert "foo".

Note: This only works for comments, not the issue itself (i.e. the original post).

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Arbitrary JS code can be executed. I'm not quite sure *how* you could abuse this (make someone quote your own comment, hope for them to edit theirsâ€¦) but it's definitely a security issue. I'm gonna flag this as confidential since I don't know exactly how bad it is.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Escape properly, don't let arbitrary code get executed.
