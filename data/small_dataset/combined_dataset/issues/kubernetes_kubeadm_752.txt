Front proxy ca private key has to be shared accross all nodes


FEATURE REQUEST
You can externalize the CA and delegate tls cert management to a third party
But actually, you can't do it with the front proxy ca as kubeadm requires
the private key to be installed on all master nodes.
see:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kubeadm/app/phases/certs/certs.go#L639
Versions
kubeadm version (use kubeadm version):
1.10.0
What you expected
That the front ca key is not required as the front proxy client tls keypair can be managed by the third party.
