Quick proof of concept to allow for custom request matchers in the security bundle.
This would allow for matching a request based on a route name (routing happens before security!).
With only this setting it would still be cumbersome to do it though;
access_control:
  - { matcher: service_matching_route1 }
  - { matcher: service_matching_route2 }
  # etc
To solve this we could allow arguments or have it built in:
access_control:
  - { matcher: generic_route_matcher, matcher_arguments: [route1] }
  - { route: route2 }
edit: added ChainRequestMatcher as it could be useful to have a complex matcher built from simple matchers. Allows to refactor the current RequestMatcher to be built from MethodRequestMatcher, SchemeRequestMatchter, etc. I would like this kind of reuseability a lot :)
edit2: added separated PR for it (#20274)
