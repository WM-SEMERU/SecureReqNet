Mist updater should be more informative about security patches


System information
Version: `0.8.6` (probably all)
OS & Version: all
Node type: `(default)`

Description
When starting an old version of Mist, an update-window appears:

The information does not say anything more than that a new version is available. There should be at least a very brief explanation; particularly when the new version is  a security-related update.
Something like
"A new version of Mist is available. This is a security update, and we strongly recommend updating!"
