A request came in from a customer who wanted to use GitLab in a high-security environment and did not feel that private tokens satisfied their security requirements (expiration, strength, monitoring, etc.). 

It would be great to have the option to disable private tokens across an instance, for non-admin users or admin users, or make them read-only.

Disabling tokens would have the effect of disabling the API. Some users are willing to accept that trade-off.
