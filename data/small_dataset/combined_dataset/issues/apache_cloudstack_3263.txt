SSVM uses the guest network to mount NFS SS instead of the management network


Hi,
4.11.2 + KVM, ADV +SG zone.
One management network + one guest network  - no dedicated sstorage network, public IPv4 everywhere.
I am having a hard time mounting the FreeNAS NFS share, turns out the SSVM uses the guest network to access the NFS server (as shown by "ip ro get").
Obviously, I can't add the guest network to the NFS ACL, any client VM would be able to mount the share.
Ideas?
