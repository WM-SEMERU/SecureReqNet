Description of the Change
This dependency was added in #730 as a way to always know how to access the node-gyp binary. However, npm has been bumped several times since then without touching node-gyp, leaving it quite outdated. I believe it should be fine to remove this dependency and simply rely on the version npm ships with.
Alternate Designs
Update it to the version npm ships with.
Benefits
Less packages to maintain. This should also unblock using Visual Studio 2017 build tools.
Possible Drawbacks
npm's directory flattening scheme may change, which will require us to update the node-gyp search path. I think if it does change, we'll notice it fairly quickly and be able to change the path without too much hassle.
Verification Process
None yet.
Applicable Issues
None.
