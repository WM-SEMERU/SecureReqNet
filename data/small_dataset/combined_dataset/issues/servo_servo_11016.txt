Servo does not do TLS hostname verification


Servo is built on hyper, which does not yet do TLS hostname verification. I believe without this TLS is essentially insecure.
@sfackler is working on this problem now, which will be solved by a combination of https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl-verify to add verification for OpenSSL and https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls which is a platform-specific TLS backend that uses the native stacks on OS X and Windows (and also does hostname verification).
