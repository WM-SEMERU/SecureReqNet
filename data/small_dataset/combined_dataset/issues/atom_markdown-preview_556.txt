Provide service for rendering markdown to HTML


When working on the atom-ide-datatip package I was re-creating basic functionality to render the markdown delivered by the Language Server into HTML that can be displayed as part of an overlay. By doing so I currently miss some of the advanced features such as syntax highlighting of code snippets in the markdown string.
After briefly looking into the rendering code here (lib/renderer.coffee) I was thinking of the possibility to introduce a consumable service here that will allow other Atom packages to interact with the markdown renderer to get properly formatted output.
What's your opinion on that? If you find this suitable for the current package I would start investigating this further and provide you a PR on that.
