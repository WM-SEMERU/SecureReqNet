Split Voter in "Creating the customer Voter"


https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/voters.html#creating-the-custom-voter
My opinion here would be that this should be 2 separate voters, one for the view and one for the edit.
I would like to create a PR for this if you think it is a good idea?
Or even a better idea would be to show just edit or view, and drop the other one.
