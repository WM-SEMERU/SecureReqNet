Found as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infrastructure/issues/2773:

```ruby
Namespace.find_by(path: 'gitlab-org').send(:force_share_with_group_lock_on_descendants)
```

This will produce:

```sql
UPDATE "namespaces" SET "share_with_group_lock" = 't'
```

This is a massive issue since it allows one to:

1. Set `share_with_group_lock` for everybody (which at this point has probably already messed up namespaces)
2. DoS attack GitLab.com by triggering this procedure many times

This needs to be fixed ASAP as we're already getting hit by this on GitLab.com.
