In my reproducer, dumping 12k routes goes from 40s to 3s without xdebug, and from 50s to 12s with xdebug.
There is a lower level issue which is that strpos is called 16M times, but that's still a lot faster than calling preg_match 16M times. Reducing the number of checks is certainly possible, but that would be more involving. This could happen on master if someone is up to dig into it.
