Run on client machine: text incorrectly specifices that the server certificate has to be copied


File: engine/security/https.md
I believe the text here in is incorrect but I am not entirely sure. Just before the part that says "Run it on the client machine" it reads:

To connect to Docker and validate its certificate, provide your client keys, certificates and trusted CA:

Then it reads:

This step should be run on your Docker client machine. As such, you need to copy your CA certificate, your server certificate, and your client certificate to that machine.

And finally the example shows:
$ docker --tlsverify --tlscacert=ca.pem --tlscert=cert.pem --tlskey=key.pem \
  -H=$HOST:2376 version

As such, the bolded text above (server certificate) seems incorrect. It should say "client key" instead. Or at least it looks at it from the preceding text and the code example
