Mask password entry


Bot Info 

App ID:
SDK Platform: C#
SDK Version: 3.11
Deployment Environment: Auzure Bot Service, Azure App Service

Issue Description
Mask password entry,
Please, I havn't found anywhere the ability to mask the user's password entry using the botframework
in C#, It will be great if this feature was added, since it will make password input more secure for scenarios where the user should login.
