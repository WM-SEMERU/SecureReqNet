Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?
FEATURE REQUEST
Currently kubeadm join only accept either the hash of the CA certificate using the discovery-token-ca-cert-hash parameter or one can simply skip this validation and simply trust the next best control plane that introduces itself.
There are environments (pre-generated PKI) where it is just as easy to transfer the whole CA certificate from the control plane also to the worker nodes as it is to create the required hash and have the nodes use that on their kubeadm join.
I propose to enable certificate pinning of kubeadm join not just by hash, but also by referencing the whole certificate.
