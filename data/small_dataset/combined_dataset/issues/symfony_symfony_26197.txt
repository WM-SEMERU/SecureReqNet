Hello,
I recently tried to upgrade my Symfony application from version 3.3.x to 3.4.x. Everything was ok until it came to container compiling. The problem is that i have a completely custom SwitchUserListener (constructor included), but changes made here and here throw the following error :
[Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Exception\OutOfBoundsException] 
Service "security.authentication.switchuser_listener.main": The index "9" is not in the range [0, 8]. 


In fact I had to override everything in the custom listener as almost everything in the Symfony SwitchUserListener are marked as private. In Symfony 3.3, the latter used only 9 parameters in its constructor, but it now uses 10.
Plus, there is no way to re-use the Symfony base Listener, nor to override it without breaking BC.
Tried solutions :

Extending the base SwitchUserListener
Decorating base SwitchUserListener with custom SwitchUserListener

For the moment, I added the $stateless parameter to my custom SwitchUserListener, and changed the declaration of my service.
