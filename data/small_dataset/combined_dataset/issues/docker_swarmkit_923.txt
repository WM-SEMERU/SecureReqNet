Fix re-registration of nodes


Given that we already have strong identity we should do this (regenerate the session on each registration, kicking the old nodes).
    // NOTE(stevvooe): We need be a little careful with re-registration. The
    // current implementation just matches the node id and then gives away the
    // sessionID. If we ever want to use sessionID as a secret, which we may
    // want to, this is giving away the keys to the kitchen.
    //
    // The right behavior is going to be informed by identity. Basically, each
    // time a node registers, we invalidate the session and issue a new
    // session, once identity is proven. This will cause misbehaved agents to
    // be kicked when multiple connections are made.
