Policies on Labels and Selectors


Suppose there is one namespace with two users.

Trustworthy Tammy is trusted to manage the prod pods.
Fat-fingered Fred is only trusted to manage the dev pods.  fred is prone to making mistakes.

Tammy makes a service that selects pods with "type=prod".
Now, say Fred starts some buggy code in pods.  He meant to apply label "type=dev", but by accident he applies "type=prod".  Now user requests are hitting his buggy servers.
We should have a way to control who can apply and select a certain label-key-value.  ABAC policy could certainly support this.
This is relatively low priority, since people could use namespaces to separate Fred and Tammy's pods.  But,  in the long run, I think we want to encourage people to put more things in a single namespace.
