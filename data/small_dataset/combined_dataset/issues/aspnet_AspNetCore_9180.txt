Rename Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.PlatformManifest.txt


Fix #8836
Description
The SDK is not reading version-conflict resolution data from our targeting pack because the manifest is in the wrong location. As a result, the SDK is copying assemblies into the build/publish output which should have come from the shared framework instead.
Customer Impact
When a project references EF Core 3.0 and ASP.NET Core 3.0,  published output is not optimized and duplicates assemblies which should have come from the shared framework.
Regression?
Yes, this is a regression from the shared framework behavior in 2.2.
Risk
Low.
