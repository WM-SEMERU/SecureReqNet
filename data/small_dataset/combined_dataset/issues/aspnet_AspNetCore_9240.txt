SignalR message order?


Hi.
I have a question about signalr order or messages that are received by client.
Situation (server code):
...
await hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("EventA", "123");
await hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("EventB", "456");
...

Can it happen that some client will receive message 456 before message 123 (note that method name is different)?
