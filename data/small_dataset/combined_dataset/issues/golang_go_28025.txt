crypto/x509: Go does not load root CA from System keychain on macOS


Disclaimer: I'm new to Go, so please excuse my general lack of knowledge.
The issue I'm experiencing seems to be related to and/or the same as #14514. It may be related to #24652 and/or #27958, but I'm not sure.
My company uses an internal root CA that is installed into the System keychain on my work Mac. All the browsers on my system trust this root correctly, and I have no trouble connecting to internal sites with certificates signed by this root.
I'm working on a Go program that needs to connect to an API that's served with a certificate signed by this internal root CA. I'm not doing anything fancy to configure my HTTP client:
client := &http.Client{Timeout: time.Second * 10}
When I try to make a request to the API, I get the following error: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.
All the issues I could find that seem to be similar to what I'm experiencing are closed, but the issue is clearly still present. I did find some links to the go-rootcerts package, which does solve the problem when I configure my client like this:
tlsConfig := &tls.Config{}
rootcerts.ConfigureTLS(tlsConfig, &rootcerts.Config{})
transport := &http.Transport{TLSClientConfig: tlsConfig}
client := &http.Client{Timeout: time.Second * 10, Transport: transport}
Obviously, having to include this just so I can develop locally is not ideal.
I have tried opening the certificate in Keychain Access and toggling the trust settings as suggested in this comment, but that didn't change anything.

What did you do?
Sorry for the lack of runnable program, but I don't think it would be helpful as the issue is somewhat specific to my system/environment.

Create a basic net/http client.
Attempt a request to an API secured by a certificate signed by a root CA in the machine's System keychain.

What did you expect to see?
Successful request/response.
What did you see instead?
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
