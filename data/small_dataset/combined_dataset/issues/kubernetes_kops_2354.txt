Add user accounts (Token/Certificate)


I would like to give access to developers to the dashboard in ReadOnly mode, i know that for RBAC i'll have to wait until 1.6 release but actually i can't even find a way to add user accounts using Token or Certificate.
Maybe i'm missing something but reading through the documentation didn't help me.
It's not clear how you should add users to the cluster with kops, kops create secret lets you create only a sshkey user to access the host machine.
In a desperate attempt i addedd manually created certs to the pki folder in the bucket but it didn't work.
So it's possible to explain how we are supposed to add users?
