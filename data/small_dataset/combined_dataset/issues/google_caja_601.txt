validating the syntax generated by cajoler is difficult


Original issue 601 created by felix8a on 2008-06-13T17:35:39.000Z:
right now, it's difficult to determine the syntax of the output of the
cajoler, mainly because each node is expected to render itself.  so, in
order to check if the rendered output can get misinterpreted by the
browser, we need to examine all the render methods of every node, reason
about the possible shape of the node tree, and consider how it gets pasted
together by the renderer.
it would be helpful if the renderer were more self-contained, perhaps
rule-driven.
this also might be an issue for the domita innerHTML emitter.
