On FF35, non-extensible objects can be extended


Original issue 1954 created by erights on 2015-02-15T17:13:28.000Z:
This is reported at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1125389 as a non-disclosed bug I was given permission to see and share in a limited manner.  It was fixed on 1/29/2015 and propagated back through FF36. It will not be propagated back to FF35, so it remains vulnerable.
Comment 6 shows a case that will demonstrate the bug in the FF35 browser:
function Obj() {
this.x = 0;
Object.preventExtensions(this);
}
var i = 0;
function test() {
var A = new Obj();
while (true) {
i++;
if (Object.isExtensible(A)) {
throw new Error("Shouldn't get here");
}
}
A.length1 = X;
}
try {
test();
} catch (e) {
console.log(e, 'iterations: ' + i);
}
