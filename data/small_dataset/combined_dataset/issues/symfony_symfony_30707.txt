Me again o/!
This proposal is purely for DX. With DelayStamp, the proposal of QueueNameStamp and future things like AmqpRoutingKeyStamp, stamps are becoming more common for end users to use. This changes how it looks to use them:
// before
$bus->dispatch(new Envelope(new SendSmsNotification('Hi!'), new DelayStamp(10), new QueueNameStamp('low')));

// after
$bus->dispatch(new SendSmsNotification('Hi!'), [new DelayStamp(10), new QueueNameStamp('low')]);
It's definitely a BC break, which is allowed because the component is experimental, though it should be minimized. This BC break shouldn't be felt by most end users, as creating your own bus is an advanced use-case. Even if you decorated it, you'll get an obvious error.
