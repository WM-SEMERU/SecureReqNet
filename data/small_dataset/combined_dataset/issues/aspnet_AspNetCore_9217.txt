Custom Host header gets malformed when using TestServer


Describe the bug
When using the TestServer and sending a request with a custom Host header, the header value gets malformed.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Using ASP.NET Core 2.1
Send an HttpRequestMessage to a TestServer's CreateClient() client with request.Host set to 'someuri.com'
Notice that the Host header that's received in the web app is "localhost,someuri.com"

Expected behavior
The value of host header in the web app should be someuri.com
The bug is in src\Hosting\TestHost\src\ClientHandler.cs, over here:
// request.Uri has localhost, so the req.Host first gets set to "localhost"
req.Host = HostString.FromUriComponent(request.RequestUri);
...
foreach (var header in request.Headers)
{
    // Append calls ParsingHelpers.AppendHeaderUnmodified, which concatenates the old header value and the new value being appended here.
    req.Headers.Append(header.Key, header.Value.ToArray());
}
