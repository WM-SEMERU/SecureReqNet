Login Form's "_target_path" assumes paths to be relative


My login form (which resides at /MyApp/web/admin/login) contains:
<input type="hidden" name="_target_path" value="{{ path('admin.home') }}" />

(/MyApp/web/admin/ is the value for _target_path).
Symfony instead redirects to /MyApp/web/MyApp/web/admin.  (Basically, base path + redirect path)
In short, the redirect doesn't work correctly if you have a Symfony application in a nested folder of another site.
Checking for a / prefix would suffice.
