How can I change the default internal dns suffix of cluster.local?


1. What kops version are you running? The command kops version, will display
this information.
Version 1.11.0 (git-2c2042465)
2. What Kubernetes version are you running? kubectl version will print the
version if a cluster is running or provide the Kubernetes version specified as
a kops flag.
