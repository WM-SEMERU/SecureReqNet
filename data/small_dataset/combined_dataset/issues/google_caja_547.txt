Should you document why primFreeze isn't needed in certain circumstances?


Original issue 547 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-12T17:10:03.000Z:
In setMember() in caja.js, should you add a comment/document why you don't
need to primFreeze the member?
More generally, should there be some place that documents when primFreeze
is and isn't needed, or the invariants surrounding whose responsibility it
is to primFreeze, for purposes of security maintenance and enabling code
review?
