Allow max rows and max segments for time-ordered scans to be overridden using the scan query JSON spec


Motivation
The configurable segment and row limits for time-ordered scans introduced in #7133 should be overridable through query parameters.  Since memory usage is proportional to # of dimensions being queried,  I think it makes sense to allow users to tune the limits based on the specific query they issue (as opposed to setting it in the config at startup).  This would allow for greater flexibility from a user's perspective.
Proposed changes
I propose adding two optional fields maxRowsQueuedForOrdering and maxSegmentPartitionsOrderedInMemory to the scan query context.  The default values will be their corresponding config properties.
Rationale
I don't think there's another way to do this
Operational impact
Likely none since #7133 hasn't been released.
