When we delete a user from OD, the server behaves correctly, and re-enabling the user works fine. But replacing a user with a new user using the same username doesn't do some necessary things:

Delete (or archive) the old user's calendar data
Remove the old user from existing ACEs on the server

Removing a user from ACEs may be tough since it means crawling the whole resource tree and cleaning house. Using UUID-based principal URIs solves this more cheaply, allowing us to do housekeeping of that sort separately.
