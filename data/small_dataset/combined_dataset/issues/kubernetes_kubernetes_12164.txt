Mesos-Docker cluster should cache certificates/keys/tokens


Once #10049 is merged, the mesos-docker cluster scripts will be generating several certificates & keys, for development use.
Optimally, these should be cached in a location outside of the repo.
Possible cache location: ~/.kube/cluster/mesos/docker/
Reasons:

(slightly) speed up deployment
allow the user to supply their own certs/keys
reuse keys across deployments
