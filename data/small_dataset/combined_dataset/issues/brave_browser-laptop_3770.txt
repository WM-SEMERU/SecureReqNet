Yes
Describe the issue you encountered:
When testing #3443 it was discovered that re-locking the page exhibits counterintuitive behavior. It merely displays the unlocked status rather than re-locking.
Expected behavior:
If a user clicks on a closed lock, it should open. If a user clicks on an open lock, it should close.

Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?):
Tested on OS X
Brave Version:
0.12.0
Steps to reproduce:

Visit https://forgetfulbc.blogspot.com/2016/08/lastweek-t3.html
Click on the blue lock in the URL bar
Attempt to click on it a second time
