dispatcher: add per-node, session allocation rate limiting


Currently, two nodes carrying identical key material will mutually invalidate each other sessions. This can can happen if there is a misconfiguration, where two nodes get the same identity. To protect against this condition, we always invalidate an existing session and issue a new one.
To avoid high frequency fight over obtaining a session in this scenario, we should add per-node session rate limiting, such that only a certain number of sessions can be assigned per time period.
The result should be that the condition is both easier to detect and doesn't result in thrashing in the dispatcher.
Note that this feature must be in the dispatcher. Ideally, the rate limiting state gets stored directly on the node object.
