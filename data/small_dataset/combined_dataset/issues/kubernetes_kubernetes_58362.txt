Add a subresource for Node.ConfigSource?


Use-cases:

Restrict access to the config source as tightly as possible, even if write access to other parts of Node is more widespread
Providers can use webhook authorizers that return a deny response to block access to Node.ConfigSource, in the case that they are responsible for managing node config, without having to restrict write access to the entire Node.

This needs to be figured out before dynamic config can graduate.
