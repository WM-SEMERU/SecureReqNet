proposal: crypto/tls: implement Session IDs resumption


What version of Go are you using (go version)?
go version go1.10 linux/amd64
Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
Yes
What did you do?
Crypto/tls today only implements session ticket resumption described in RFC 5077. Per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TLS_implementations#Extensions JSSE does not support session ticket resumption, so I'm looking for a way to speed up the TLS handshake between Golang and Java applications
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246 (The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2) describes the session resumption, also useful to speed up the TLS handshake. It is implemented by OpenSSL and JSSE. Implementation should have a public interface similar to the OpenSSL's SSL_CTX_add_session() to inject the sessions in the server cache.
