Are you interested that I add a new P.R. to support port in access_control?
Currently if we would like to use access_control to redirect at, for example, localhost:8080, it is not possible.
So for improve this possibility I suggest to add a new key named port.
Because Request::getHost() only retrieve the host without port.
And this is what is used to compare at this place 


symfony/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/RequestMatcher.php


         Line 166

  if (null !== $this->host && !preg_match('{'.$this->host.'}i', $request->getHost())) { 





Or we could go even further by adding a new key named redirect_to and if all is respected, we could use the key redirect the user to the value of this key.
What do think of that?
