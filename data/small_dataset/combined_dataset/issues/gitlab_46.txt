The [GitLab upgrader documentation][1] does not mention anything about upgrading `gitlab-shell`, while if I were to manually upgrade my GitLab instance according to the [From 6.4 to 6.5 documentation][2] it tells me to also upgrade `gitlab-shell`. Is this by purpose? I did not notice the upgrade script do any upgrades on `gitlab-shell`.
