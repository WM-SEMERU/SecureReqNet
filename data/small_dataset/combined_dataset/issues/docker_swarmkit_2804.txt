Make Service.UpdateStatus non-ambiguous


See moby/moby#38520 for some background on this change
In situations where only annotations of a service are updated, SwarmKit never
marks a service as UpdateStateUpdating; the service's UpdateStatus is set
to nil, and never updated after.
Because of this, it's not possible to verify if an update actually happened /
reconciled, unless resorting to hacky solutions, such as comparing the services
Version before and after.
Even those hacky solutions are not useful, because this requires knowledge
about which conditions require tasks to be updated, and which conditions not (
and require UpdateStatus to be checked). Such knowledge should be internal to
SwarmKit, and not needed for users of the API.
This patch modifies the behavior code to try to make this situation
non-ambigious, by marking services as "updated" in all cases where the service
has reconciled.
Note that this patch causes an extra update to be performed (to write the
service's UpdateStatus to the store). If this is a concern, we could possibly
modify controlapi.UpdateService() to write the UpdateStatus immediately,
instead of setting it to nil.
