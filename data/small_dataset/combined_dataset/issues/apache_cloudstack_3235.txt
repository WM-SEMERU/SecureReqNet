[WIP DO NOT MERGE] network: allow ability to specify if network's ipaddress usage need to be hidden


Problem: Admins don’t want to charge for IP address usage on certain (shared) networks.
Root Cause: There is no flag or detail for admins to provide using UI or API when creating networks to specify
if they want IP address usage of the network hidden.
Solution: A new boolean hideipaddressusage flag is added to the createNetwork API and a checkbox in the
‘Add guest network’ UI for the root admins to specify if they want the (shared) network’s IP address usage to
be hidden in the listUsageRecords API response. The provided flag is saved as the ‘hideIpAddressUsage’
detail in the cloud.network_details table for the network. For existing (shared) networks, root admins can
also specify the same boolean API parameter hideipaddressusage with the updateNetwork API request to
configure the behaviour for an existing network. When the detail/flag is true, the IP address usage for the
(shared) network is not exported in the listUsageRecords API response. The listNetworks API response will
include the details of a network for root admin only. (note usage is still recorded in the usage database but
not return by the listUsageRecords API)
Types of changes

 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)
 New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
 Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
 Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)
 Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)

This adds a new API arg only accessible to admins to specify if they
want the network's ip address usage hidden. This then saves this setting
in the network_details table for a network, and the listUsageRecords
API response creator checks for an IP address if it needs to be exported
or skipped/hidden.
The setting is available only to root admin via the listNetworks API response (details key).
Root admin can also update existing networks by using updateNetwork API and passing hideipaddressusage=true|false
UI screenshot, that adds this checkbox only for admins creating a shared network:

**note: it's possible for all other kinds of networks to have their ip address usages skipped as well, available via the API.
