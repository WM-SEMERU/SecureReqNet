[3.0][Security] target path and security.exception_listener.class


Hey all, I ran into this cookbook article http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/target_path.html
Since in 3.0 the .class parameters will be gone (see #11881)  this method of overriding will no longer work. Also, since the Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\ExceptionListener does not implement an interface, It cannot be decorated properly without implementing the whole class again.
So, in 3.0 it would no longer be possible to change the default Target Path behavior if this is not refactored.
