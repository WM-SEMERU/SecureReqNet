Allow Custom CSS Variables in [ngStyle]


This could be both a bug or a feature request …
Current behavior
When binding a custom CSS variable via [style.--feat-image]=...' or [ngStyle]=“{‘--feat-image’: … }” the property is ignored by angular and not bound. I assume there is a whitelist for certain (CSS) properties, which does not include possible CSS variables yet.
Expected/desired behavior
The value should be bound. If a whitelist of properties is needed, one fix could be to allow any property starting with --.
