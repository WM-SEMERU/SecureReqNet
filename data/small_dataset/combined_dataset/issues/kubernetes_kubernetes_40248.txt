Establish base image policy for system containers


We should establish a standard base image for use across all of our "system" containers. I'm defining system containers to be containers that part of the Kubernetes release, and run in production (e.g. kubeproxy, kube-dns, heapster, dashboard, etc.)
Motivation

Using a common base image (and version!) greatly simplifies CVE management, and also lets us standardize our build tooling & process.
We can invest the time to make an informed technical decision around a single base image, rather than a separate (and historically less well thought out) decision for each container.
Docker layer caching means less disk space & faster downloads

Considerations

Dynamically loaded libraries: some images (e.g. kubeproxy, fluentd) rely on more than a statically built binary, so basing off something like scratch is non-trivial.
Debugging: Current debugging practices commonly rely on executing debug tools within the container, generally through kubectl exec + shell. There are several proposals to fix this (#35584, #10834), but for the time being basic tools (ala busybox) are a requirement.
Timely security patches:  Some distributions are more responsive with rapid security patches than others. Timely security patches is a requirement, but "timely" is ill-defined.
Supported architectures:  We provide releases for some less-common platforms that may not be supported by some base images. If some architectures don't require production level hardening, we may be able to provide an alternative base for them.
CVE tracking: Some images have better CVE feeds & tool integrations than others. E.g. Clair will provide CVE info for Alpine, but not Busybox.
