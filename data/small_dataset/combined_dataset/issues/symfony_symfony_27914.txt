On the profiler (security tab), the decisions made by the AccessDecisionManager are displayed with the voters registered in the application. But there is no information about which voter was really used for each AccessDecisionManager choice and which result the voters returned.
This PR allows to display for each AccessDecisionManager choice, the voters implicated and the vote they returned.
