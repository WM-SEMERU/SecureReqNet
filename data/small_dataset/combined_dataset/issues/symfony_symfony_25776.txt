Over a year ago, a new json_login firewall option was introduced (see here). Unfortunately, this does not allow the parameter login_path in order to redirect users to login if they access a route.
Configuring both form_login and json_login doesnt work because form_login is used instead of json_login, even if form_login has no check_path defined
