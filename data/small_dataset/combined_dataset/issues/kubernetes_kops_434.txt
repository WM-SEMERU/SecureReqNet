Kops doesn't fail when it does not have access to the Route53 zone


Hello,
I created a K8s cluster with kops. Following the README, I created a R53 zone, but in another AWS account. kops was happy to continue and did not report any problem. It took me a while to understand that in fact kops should have created automatically some entries in the zone.
So, I think kops should throw some errors here. Also, the doc should explicit what the R53 zone is used for, what entries should be created, etc.
Thanks for the work!
