disable non-chrome-extension origins from navigating to chrome-extension


independent of #14712 , we should generally not allow origins that are not chrome-extension to navigate to chrome-extension
note it's already blocked in some origins like http and https
TEST PLAN:

save the following to a local file

<html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=chrome-extension://mnojpmjdmbbfmejpflffifhffcmidifd/about-preferences.html" />
        <title>Page Moved</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        This page has moved. 
    </body>
</html>


open it in brave
it should navigate to about:blank instead of about:preferences
