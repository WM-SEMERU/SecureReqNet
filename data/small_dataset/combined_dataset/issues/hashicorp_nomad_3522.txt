Add support for wrapped tokens


Nomad, via the vault stanza, supports the retrieval of a Vault Token and the introduction of this secret into a scheduled job. At present, it only supports unwrapped tokens. If a token were intercepted, it would allow an actor to make requests to obtain secrets within our system.
Vault has support for wrapped tokens. This methodology allows the process performing secret introduction to only have access to a token with a limited lifetime while also providing cover and malfeasance detection.
I think this is an important security feature that should be included within Nomad.
