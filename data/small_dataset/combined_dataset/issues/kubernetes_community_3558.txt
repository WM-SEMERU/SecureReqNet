REQUEST: Rename Slack channel: #ksonnet -> #jsonnet


The "ksonnet" project is shutting down.  Some parts of the project (notably kubecfg) live on, as does the emergent jsonnet<->kubernetes community that use this channel.
To better reflect its focus, can we rename #ksonnet to #jsonnet ?
(Thanks in advance)
