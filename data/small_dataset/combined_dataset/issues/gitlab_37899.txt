### Description

As requested by by customer:

> Our servers have to be FIPS compliance(FIPS does not allow MD5 hashes) ... ultimately AES256-SHA

### Proposal

It looks like we use the `digest/md5` library in 2 places:

```
$ ag digest/md5
app/helpers/application_helper.rb
1:require 'digest/md5'

app/models/key.rb
1:require 'digest/md5'
```

According to the customer MD5 is not FIPS compliant.  Are we able to use another hashing algorithm instead?  Or make it a configurable option?
