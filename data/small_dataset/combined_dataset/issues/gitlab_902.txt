I'd like to report a fairly serious bug. A user accidentally force pushed to a protected branch and removed some history. This technically should never have happened because:

1. The user only had Developer access to the project
2. As of GitLab v6.8 and GitLab Shell v1.9.3, no user is ever allowed to force push to a protected branch regardless of access level

Here is the version of GitLab I'm running:
