I propose to remove TemplatedEmail::template() for several reasons:


There is no real benefit over using textTemplate and htmlTemplate (ok, you only have one template instead of two... but the text template can only be automatically created based on the HTML one, so...);


It means having more than one way to do the same thing (do I set the subject on the object directly or in the template for instance);


A major drawback that is not easy to spot: the template is HTML, so the subject and text block must be carefully crafted to avoid avoid HTML escaping.
