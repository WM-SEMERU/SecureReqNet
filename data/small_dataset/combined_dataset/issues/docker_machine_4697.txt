MacOS - docker-machine - Error getting active host: dial tcp: lookup ????N1: invalid domain name


Hello,
When I tried :
$docker version
Version:           18.09.3
 API version:       1.39
 Go version:        go1.12
 Git commit:        774a1f4
 Built:             Fri Mar  1 04:14:53 2019
 OS/Arch:           darwin/amd64
 Experimental:      false
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

Thus I tried :
$ eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
dial tcp: missing brackets in address ?(%m?N1:49960

Finally I tried :
$ docker-machine ls
dial tcp: lookup ???1?N1: invalid domain name

One year ago, docker on my Mac was working like a charm, and now everything seems broken.
I desinstall docker, reinstall, reinstall with cask. Nothing better.
