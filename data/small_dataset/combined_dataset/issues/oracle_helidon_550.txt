Add OpenAPI runtime support to SE


Add OpenAPI runtime support to Helidon SE.
Because SE does not focus on annotations, the OpenAPI support in SE will concentrate on using a static OpenAPI document packaged with the app that describes the app's endpoints.
See issue #412 (OpenAPI support in general).
