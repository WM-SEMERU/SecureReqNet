eof parsing anomaly


Original issue 658 created by felix8a on 2008-07-23T18:08:53.000Z:
this anomaly is harmless.  I don't think it needs to be fixed.  I'm
reporting it because I wasn't sure it was safe, so I tracked down the cause.

if you cajole "<div\n", you get
Fatal Exception: com.google.caja.lexer.ParseException:
Unexpected end of input
which is fine.
if you cajole "<div" without a trailing newline, you get
IMPORTS___.htmlEmitter___.pc('\074div');
which is strange, but harmless.

what's happening:
in case 2, when HtmlInputSplitter.parseToken sees eof, it converts the
pending token into a TEXT token.
in case 1, HtmlInputSplitter.parseToken sees the newline, returns a
TAGSTART token, and then DomParser.parseDom keeps requesting tokens until
it sees a TAGEND.  the tokens come from a TokenQueue<>, which throws the
exception at eof.
