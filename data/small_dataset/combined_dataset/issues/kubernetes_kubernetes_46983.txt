GLBC controller is accessing the API through the insecure port


The GLBC controller is accessing the insecure port on the master, which means it skips authentication. This is an issue for audit logging, as it shows up as user="system:insecured" rather than a proper service account identity.
To fix this, the pod should be configured with a service account identity, and the --running-in-cluster flag should be set to true so that the kubernetes client is configured to use the service account.
