Currently you need to copy the whole form_row block if you just want to add a class to the form_row div. Instead we could introduce a row_attr which can then simple be set the following in the theme e.g.:
{% block form_row %}
    {% set row_attr = { class: 'form__field' } %}
    {{ parent() }}
{% endblock %}
or in php:
$builder->add('test', TextType::class, ['row_attr' => ['class' => 'form__field']]);
