[Security] Strange behaviour of Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\LogoutListener


Hi,
There is a problem with handler usage in Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\LogoutListener.
The problem occurs in this case:

You hit directly the logout route without being authenticated (route defined with roles "IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY")
You use RememberMe

In this case, le first logout won't work because the handlers are only called when a Security Token is set and the "delete RememberMe" handler "Symfony\Component\Security\Http\RememberMe\PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices" is one of these handler.
It is strange to think that a logoutAction doesn't always delete RememberMe, meaning that the user will be authenticated at the next hit.
The problem is the same for this handler "Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Logout\CookieClearingLogoutHandler".
Seems that there is no need to restrict the handlers execution with the existence of the SecurityToken because they don't use it:

PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices use only Request
CookieClearingLogoutHandler use only Response
And even SessionLogoutHandler use only Request

I think there is three ways for solve that:

Ensure that the user will be authenticated before the LogoutListener->handle is called
Remove the Security Token restriction to call these handlers
Add an INTERACTIVE_LOGOUT event to call these handler (thanks to @alexandresalome for this idea)

If you have any question on that problem or if you need any help (code example) to solve it, I'm in.
Thanks for your help.
Xavier
