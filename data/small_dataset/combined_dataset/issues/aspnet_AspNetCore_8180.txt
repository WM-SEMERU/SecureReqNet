.Net Core 2.2 Auth AzureAD Startup Generated Code is Complete?


From @DanJ210 on Wednesday, 20 February 2019 16:08:02
Generated startup code is very light and when I try it in other .Net Core 2.2 MVC Web Applications it doesn't work. I'm trying to find documentation on this small snippet of code but the .Net Core documentation is on 2.0 and doesn't talk about what's going on in 2.2, .Net Core Documentation
General
The code below is all that's in the .Net Core Startup.cs file to enable AzureAD auth. In previous .Net Core versions I had an AccountController.cs along with a couple of other files. In this, 2.2 version, there is none of those files which would be great if they are no longer needed in 2.2. But I'm trying to figure out how this is working because I'm updating .Net Core Web Apps that I have to 2.2 and I'm using the same code as shown below but am being told that No AuthenticationScheme was specified, and there was no DefaultChallengeScheme found. Which makes sense because it's not declared in Startup.cs but then how does this work for the app that .Net Core generates and not other apps?
So this is what I'm trying to understand, how does the code below work for the generated 2.2 .Net Core app and not when added to other 2.2 .Net Core apps?
services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));

            services.AddMvc(options =>
            {
                var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
                    .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
                    .Build();
                options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
            })
            .SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
