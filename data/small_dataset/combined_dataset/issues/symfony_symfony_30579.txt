Currently AMQP does auto-setup of queues/exchanges in dev-mode only. That's a problem for 2 reasons:


Behavior in prod is drastically different... and actually... there's not currently a way I know of (easily) to set things up on prod.


One of the properties of AMQP is that you typically DO want things to be set up at runtime, as you need them - you usually do want auto-setup.


This changes the behavior to auto-setup true always.
