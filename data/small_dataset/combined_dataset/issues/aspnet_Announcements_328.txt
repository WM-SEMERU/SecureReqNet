Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices and NodeServices no longer fallback to console logger by default


Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices and Microsoft.AspNetCore.NodeServices used to automatically create a console logger when logging is not configured. To align them with how other AspNetCore packages implement logging we are removing this automatic fallback.
From now on Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices and Microsoft.AspNetCore.NodeServices would not display any console log when logging is not configured.
To configure console logging please add services.AddLogging(builder => builder.AddConsole()) to your Setup.ConfigureServices method.
