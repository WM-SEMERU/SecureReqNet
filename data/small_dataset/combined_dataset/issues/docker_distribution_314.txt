registry/api/v2: stronger validation for uuid field in urls


This change adds strong validation for the uuid variable for v2 routes. This is
a minor specification change but is okay since the uuid field is controlled by
the server. The character set is restricted to avoid path traversal, allowing
for alphanumeric values and urlsafe base64 encoding.
This change has no effect on client implementations.
