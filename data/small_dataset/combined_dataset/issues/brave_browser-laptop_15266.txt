Large Files in the File system?


Carried over from brave/brave-browser#1423
Description
I was looking through my computer's drive in WinDirStat to try and free up some space. and noticed two large files located in C:\Users[redacted]\AppData\Roaming\brave\File System\001\p\00
I cannot open them with 7-zip, so I assume that they aren't archives. I'm not sure if this belongs in brave-browser or brave-core because I have Brave, Brave Dev, and Brave Beta installed on my computer.
I am running Windows 10 version 1803, and newest versions of all of the browsers.
Steps to Reproduce

Go to %appdata%\brave\File System\001\p\00
