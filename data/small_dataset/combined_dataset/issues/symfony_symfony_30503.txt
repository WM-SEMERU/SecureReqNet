Use APP_ENV when running yarn encore


Would it be possible to utilize APP_ENV variable when running yarn encore?
So instead of yarn encore dev or yarn encore production I would do yarn encore.
More explicit option would be yarn encore env that selects dev or production based on APP_ENV.
This would avoid duplication of install/deploy configurations between production and development.
Rest of Symfony is doing that already.
