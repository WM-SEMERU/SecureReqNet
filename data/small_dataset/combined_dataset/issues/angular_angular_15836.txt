Current behavior
When using the [style.background-image] binding, if your source URL contains the string parameter src=, this fails the sanitization process, and no background image url is added to the element.
Expected behavior
I would expect that the URL I am binding to the [style.background-image] property would be passed through.  Especially since I don't have control over the source image to change the params on the image request.
Here's a PLUNKR that recreates the issue:
