Question regarding Antimalware Scan Interface


I've been looking through the documentation on AMSI, and noticed that it supports several types of clean / dirty results (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn889584(v=vs.85).aspx) :
typedef enum AMSI_RESULT { 
  AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN                   = 0,
  AMSI_RESULT_NOT_DETECTED            = 1,
  AMSI_RESULT_BLOCKED_BY_ADMIN_START  = 16384,
  AMSI_RESULT_BLOCKED_BY_ADMIN_END    = 20479,
  AMSI_RESULT_DETECTED                = 32768
} AMSI_RESULT;

However, when I looked through the PowerShell source code, I noticed that it's only concerned with AMSI_RESULT_DETECTED:



PowerShell/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/CompiledScriptBlock.cs


         Line 203
      in
      532044f






 if (AmsiUtils.ScanContent(scriptExtent.Text, scriptExtent.File) == AmsiUtils.AmsiNativeMethods.AMSI_RESULT.AMSI_RESULT_DETECTED) 





Should PowerShell also take action when it get something in the "BLOCKED_BY_ADMIN" result range?
