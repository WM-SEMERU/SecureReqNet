[2.1][Security] Custom AuthenticationSuccessHandler


I have an application with a custom authentication success handler. I want the users to be redirected to the place they intended to go before arriving in the login page.
I have tried to set the use_referer option to true but it seems that it does not do anything and when debugging I realized that the option was always set to false. Then, I realized that I was not redirected properly because of the provider key that was always null. and I had to set it in my service configuration file.
So my question are, have I done something wrong when creating the custom authentication handler? Is it normal to do that? Is it like a problem in the documentation which is not up to date?
Here is my custom authentication handler:
<?php

namespace Divosea\UserBundle\EventListener;

use Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Authentication\DefaultAuthenticationSuccessHandler,
    Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request,
    Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authentication\Token\TokenInterface,
    Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;

class AuthenticationSuccessHandler extends DefaultAuthenticationSuccessHandler
{
    public function onAuthenticationSuccess(Request $request, TokenInterface $token)
    {
        if ($request->isXmlHttpRequest()) {
            return new JsonResponse(array('status' => true));
        }

        return parent::onAuthenticationSuccess($request, $token);
    }
}

Here is a snippet of my config.yml file:
    firewalls:
        main:
            pattern: ^/
            form_login:
                check_path: /login-check
                provider: fos_userbundle
                csrf_provider: form.csrf_provider
                success_handler: my.authentication_success_handler
Here is the authentication handler :
parameters:
    my.authentication_success_handler.class: Divosea\UserBundle\EventListener\AuthenticationSuccessHandler

services:
    my.authentication_success_handler:
        class: %my.authentication_success_handler.class%
        arguments: [ @security.http_utils, [] ]
        calls:
            - [ setProviderKey, ["main"] ]

Thanks in advance
