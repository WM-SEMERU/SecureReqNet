Prevent blowing up on audit malformed response


npm is failing our builds with:
npm ERR! Cannot read property 'totalDependencies' of undefined

which it's coming out of auditing
There must be something wrong in whatever code is generating the response - this only prevents blowing up a valid installation because of this.
