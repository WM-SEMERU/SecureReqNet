Enable certificate verification for all services


In a few places, certificate verification is still disabled:

docker is started with --insecure-registry 10.0.0.0/8
/var/lib/kubelet/kubernetes_auth includes "Insecure": true
/var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig sets "insecure-skip-tls-verify: true"

For reference: secure node -> master communication #3168
