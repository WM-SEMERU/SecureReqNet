What happened?
When trying to setup a HA cluster with stacked control plane and etcd nodes, one needs to provide the following options to kubeadm join for master nodes:

--experimental-control-plane
--certificate-key $CERT_KEY

However if one is already passing configuration via --config, the following error is returned:
can not mix '--config' with arguments [experimental-control-plane]

According to #1251, and if I understood correctly, the below can be added to the JoinConfiguration object instead of passing --experimental-control-plane:
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: JoinConfiguration
controlPlane:
  localAPIEndpoint:
    advertiseAddress: <some-ip>
    bindPort: <some-port>
However, it is unclear where $CERT_KEY should be added.

Can it be passed to kubeadm via JoinConfiguration too? If so, where?
Can it be passed to another object? I couldn't find anything clearly referring to it in v1beta1's types. Maybe ExternalEtcd.KeyFile?

N.B.:

without --certificate-key $CERT_KEY, joining fails with:
error execution phase preflight: couldn't validate the identity of the API Server: abort connecting to API servers after timeout of 5m0s


passing --certificate-key $CERT_KEY anyway doesn't fail with can not mix but the value seems to be ignored as it eventually also times out with:
error execution phase preflight: couldn't validate the identity of the API Server: abort connecting to API servers after timeout of 5m0s



What you expected to happen?
The machine to join the cluster as a master node in order to form a HA cluster with stacked control plane and etcd nodes.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
# kubeadm join <ip>:<port> \
    --config /path/to/config.yaml \
    --experimental-control-plane \
    --certificate-key $CERT_KEY
