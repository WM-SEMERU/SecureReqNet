Change Linux signing key via keyring package


details in brave/devops#361
Note that this involves:

Rotating the key (details in issue above)
Updating the linux install documentation to show the new key

QA steps (only needs to be done on Linux):

For each linux platform, download the key that is linked in https://brave-browser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-brave.html#linux in the Release Channel section (for instance https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-core.asc)
Import the downloaded key into gpg: gpg --import /path/to/downloaded/file
Run the command gpg --list-keys $KEY_ID where KEY_ID is the ID of the key that you just imported. This should be displayed in the terminal output from step 2.
There should be no keys that show rsa2048, only rsa4096.
