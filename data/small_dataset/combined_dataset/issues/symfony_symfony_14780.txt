[Security] Custom RememberMeServices "template"


I'd like to create a custom RememberMeServicesInterface implementation, extending AbstractRememberMeServices.
The problem is that RememberMeFactory chooses between 2 hardcoded implementations ("templates") and I would have to override one of them.
That would be wrong because it would be:

bad naming (why would I "reuse" i.e. "simplehash" template if my implementation is different?),
not possible to use overridden implementation anymore.

How about a new config key in remember_me (how about just template?), so that I could point to a custom implementation? I can make a PR.
