Currently tests on the Symfony\Component\Messenger\Tests\Transport\Doctrine\DoctrineIntegrationTest are skipped because there is no MESSENGER_DOCTRINE_DSN environment variable is not defined.
This PR update the travis and AppVeyor configuration to run these tests.
This is a WIP. I'm not a Travis/AppVeyor user so this clearly need more work
