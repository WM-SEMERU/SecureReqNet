Not all inputs are cajoled


Original issue 1002 created by ben@links.org on 2009-03-09T16:32:26.000Z:
Inputs in some contexts are passed through without cajoling. In particular,
arguments to constructors are not processed. As a result, arbitrary
Javascript can be run by an attacker.
Obviously this represents a complete break.
Also, there was supposed to have been a check for this mistake (i.e. a
check that all output is the result of processing), so the check is clearly
failing.
