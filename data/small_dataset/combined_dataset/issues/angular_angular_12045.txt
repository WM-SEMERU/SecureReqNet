[RFC]elements schema: add support for custom schemas


in @Compoent, schemas can currently only use the following values:

CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA -> allow any custom-tag with any property,
NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA -> allow any tag and any property

We need to implement a way to defined custom schemas, ie defining all polymer elements and their properties (and events).
@mprobst when would you be available so that we can discuss how to integrate with the security schema ?
