When attempting to register a provider in the security bundle, I am greeted with the following error when trying to execute anything within the symfony stack:
$ bin/console -vvv

In ArrayNode.php line 319:
                                                                                 
  [Symfony\Component\Config\Definition\Exception\InvalidConfigurationException]  
  Unrecognized option "entity" under "security.providers.my_entity_provider"     
                                                                                 

I have consulted the docs and do see in the MainConfiguration.php Line 316, that the providers element is a prototype array and using attribute as key.
My Configuration
security:
    encoders:
        NameSpace\To\Entity\User:
            algorithm: bcrypt

    providers:
        my_entity_provider:
            entity:
                class: NameSpace\To\Entity\User
                property: email

Expected Outcome
No error, since provider configuration is correctly formatted/configured
