 fix the test according to feedback

For my first PR, I tried to fix the Symfony's oldest still open bug (2011!)
New tests have been added to reproduce the bug and are now passing.
To be reviewed carefully as it deals with security.
From my understanding, the problem comes from the AbstractPreAuthenticatedListener that is not stateless: whenever a token is passed, it has to preauthenticate again.
Problem, even if another type of token is passed (like a UsernamePasswordToken), it still tries to authenticate it and as it failed it creates a new one with the current user.
This behaviour doesn't work when switching user because the new artificial user token is automatically replaced by the current preauthenticated token.
So the patch bypass this check if (and only if) a token is already there (given by context), it is already correctly authenticated, and it is of another class than PreAuthenticatedToken (to limit risks of BC break).
Problem: this new behaviour breaks (by design) the following test:
Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Tests\Firewall\AbstractPreAuthenticatedListenerTest::testHandleWhenAuthenticationFailsWithDifferentToken
To be discussed: is this new behaviour correct (it may fix other bugs), or is there potential security issues? Should it be considered as a BC break?
