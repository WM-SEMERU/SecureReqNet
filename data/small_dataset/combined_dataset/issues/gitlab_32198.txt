'### Summary

Disabling OAuth sign-in in Admin settings should never allow a user to login using their OAuth account.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Enable GitHub integration (http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/integration/github.html)
2. Configure LDAP connection (might work with normal accounts as well, but tested with an LDAP login)
3. Disable GitHub OAuth Sign-in under Sign-In Restrictions on the Admin settings page
4. Logon to an LDAP account and connect it to your GitHub account
5. Logout of the GitLab installation and ensure you are also logged out of GitHub.
6. Bring up the login page and edit the form definition so that it posts back to "/users/auth/github" instead of ldapmain: `
<form id="new_ldap_user" class="gl-show-field-errors" action="/users/auth/github" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
</form>`
7. Enter any values into the username and password field for the ldap credentials and click sign in.
8. If you are logged into GitHub you will be logged in without any more prompts.  If you aren't logged into GitHub you will be prompted to logon and when you do you will be given access.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

I am either logged into GitLab using my provided GitHub credentials, or if already logged into GitHub I'm logged into the associated account.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Login should not be allowed.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

Confirmation that sign-in to GitHub is disabled:

Changed html before posting (also shows that the OAuth logins are actually disabled as no icons below the login form):

Confirmation that the login happened by GitHub:

### Output of checks

Very minor change for LDAP logons and support for MySQL are the only differences with the main omnibus gitlab installation.  Built from fork at https://gitlab.com/stevenorman/gitlab-ce

### Possible fixes

Route for GitHub logins (and probably other OAuth providers) should be checking for the relevant application setting.
