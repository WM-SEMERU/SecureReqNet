[2.7] Document the new LogoutUrlExtension


As of 2.7, a new LogoutUrlExtension was added. This brings two new Twig functions:

logout_url(key = null) - absolute logout URL (key is the firewall, null is current firewall)
logout_path(key = null) - relative logout URL

These have to be documented in the references/twig_reference.rst.
