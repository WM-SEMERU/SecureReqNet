Allow IReconnectPolicy.nextRetryDelayInMilliseconds to return a promise in the SignalR TS client


Epic #8797
See https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/8566/files#r269656331
The following is the current signature for IReconnectPolicy.nextRetryDelayInMilliseconds
/** An abstraction that controls when the client attempts to reconnect and how many times it does so. */
export interface IReconnectPolicy {
    /** Called after the transport loses the connection.
     *
     * @param {number} previousRetryCount The number of failed reconnect attempts so far.
     *
     * @param {number} elapsedMilliseconds The amount of time in milliseconds spent reconnecting so far.
     *
     * @returns {number | null} The amount of time in milliseconds to wait before the next reconnect attempt. `null` tells the client to stop retrying and close.
     */
    nextRetryDelayInMilliseconds(previousRetryCount: number, elapsedMilliseconds: number): number | null;
}

The proposal is to change it to:
    nextRetryDelayInMilliseconds(previousRetryCount: number, elapsedMilliseconds: number): number | Promise<void> | null
If a promise is returned instead of a number, we'd await the promise instead of the set number of milliseconds.
