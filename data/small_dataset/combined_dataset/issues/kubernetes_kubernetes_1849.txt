Nodes need to be able to talk to apiserver


Right now, there's no way for proxy or kubelet to send traffic to apiserver (e.g., watches, lists, gets, or creating events). This is because we don't distribute username & password to nodes, for good reason.
(Master components don't have this problem because they are colocated and talk on localhost.)
This is blocking event generation from kubelet, and removing etcd reading from proxy (and kubelet, though that's further off.)
