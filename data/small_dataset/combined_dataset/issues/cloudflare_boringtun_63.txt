Relation to Wireguard upstream


Reading this post from one of the Wireguard maintainers: https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2019-March/004048.html
Are there any specific reasons for not sharing changes upstream?
It's great that a company like Cloudflare uses an opensource project to work with, but refusing to join in on the project seems counterproductive.
Is there an official stance on this?
