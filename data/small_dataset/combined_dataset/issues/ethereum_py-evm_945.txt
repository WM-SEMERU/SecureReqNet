Prevent relaying of invalid transactions (possible DDOS attacks)


What is wrong?
The receipt and processing of transactions from peers is a potential DDOS vector.  A peer could spam us with bad transactions which could overload our node as checking the validity of a transaction isn't cheap.
This can also cause us to be disconnected from other peers if we relay these bad transactions.
How can it be fixed

We should check the validity of a transaction before relating it.
We should disconnect from peers who send us too many invalid transactions.
