garbagecollector: use the generic informer factory


As part of work while doing resource quota controller, I added a
new GenericInformerFactory inside ControllerContext. Basically it
is a proxy for typed informer factory and dynamic informer factory.
It can give us both dynamic informers along with typed informers.
