Long paths bypass Santa


vn_getpath() may return errors, for instance, if the path is longer than MAXPATHLEN (there may be other cases as well).
In such cases the executable will be allowed to execute.
For example, the following execution of a new binary isn't blocked:
cd /tmp
for i in {1..4}; do mkdir `python -c "print 255 * 'x'"`; cd $_; done
echo "int main() { return 0; }" | gcc -x c -
./a.out
