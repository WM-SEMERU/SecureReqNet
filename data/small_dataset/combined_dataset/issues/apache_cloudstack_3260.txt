base64 userdata encoding fix


Description
In the cloudstack UI fields get '<', '>' and '&' replaced by xml-entities
these are generic for all fields and hurt us in the case of userdata
this fix calls the existing method to reverse character replacements.
it also removes the ccs class that pretends to prevent special chars
