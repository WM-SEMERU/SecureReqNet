There was a talk about this in #8341 and other issues but it looks like some of the core translations are still missing (including the "Bad Credentials." message).
Devs can translate them on their own if they can find them by scanning the core code for exception strings (who would want to do that?) and speak all languages.
https://github.com/symfony/security-core/blob/master/Authentication/Provider/UserAuthenticationProvider.php
'Bad Credentials.' which replaces the default 'Invalid Credentials.' exception message which IMO is a much better translation (there is nothing "bad" about your credentials...)
In https://github.com/symfony/security-core/blob/master/Authentication/Provider/DaoAuthenticationProvider.php you can find:

'The credentials were changed from another session.'
'The presented password cannot be empty.'
'The presented password is invalid.'

None are translated in https://github.com/symfony/security-core/tree/master/Resources/translations
In general the exception messages should be targeted at the devs however in this case they are shown to end users, mix'n'match.
