In 6.8.1 some email notifications were changed. When a merge request is created and assigned the assignee gets a duplicate email. One notifications says "Assignee changed from Drew Blessing to Drew Blessing" and the other says "Reassigned to @drew.blessing". I suspect one is the actual reassign action while the other is considered a comment. This should only generate a single message.
