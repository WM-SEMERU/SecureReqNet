Can’t use the “next site” feature in the comments section of spiegel.de with default shields.
Exact URL of the website in question. The site http://www.spiegel.de/ seems to block content or lose functionality in Brave. The problem seems to be HTTPS upgrades — site functions as intended after they’re turned off (or Shields down).
