Password manager autofill not always working


Description
I am testing Dashlane password manager and see some troubles when loggin in to some pages - not all. E.g. protonmail.com. The dashlane icons shows up in the log in form fields but they cannot be clicked. I sometimes saw the same issues on ther pages with the LastPass password manager.
Expected result:
You should be able to click the icons and auto fill should work (does not either)
Reproduces how often:
All the time.
