Brave fills in some password on sites, even though I explicitly turned off password management.


Test Plan

Save credentials using Brave password manager
Change Password Manager to Don't manage my password
Visit the site for which the credentials were stored
Start typing in user id field, press tab should not auto fill user name
Select the user id auto prompt, should not fill in the saved password

Describe the issue you encountered:
Even though I explicitly turned off password management in brave:



I still get:

and it doesn't even seem to mind when what the username is as long as it starts as my username as you can see from the image. The password is not correct by the way.

Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?):

macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)

Brave Version (revision SHA):

36ae2ec


Steps to reproduce:
I doubt it will be easily reproduced somewhere else.

goto github.com also seen on harvestapp.com
start typing username as soon as it starts to autocomplete tab to the password field
dots appear, I don't know whats in there it's not the correct password üòÑ



Actual result:
A password is filled in


Expected result:
Nothing happens


Will the steps above reproduce in a fresh profile? If not what other info can be added?



Made a new user on this mac,
opened brave,
turned off the password manager,
tried to log into github the first time no autocomplete
restarted brave
autocomplete on github login



Is this an issue in the currently released version?
Yea


Can this issue be consistently reproduced?
On my machine
