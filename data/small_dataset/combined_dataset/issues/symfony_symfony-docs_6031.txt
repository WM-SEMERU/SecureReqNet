Updating csrf doc for Symfony 3


Hey guys,
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/UPGRADE-3.0.md
Says this:
The options "csrf_provider" and "intention" were renamed to "csrf_token_generator" and "csrf_token_id".
However this is not updated here (for 3.0 version):
http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/csrf_in_login_form.html
I hope this is the right place for reporting it.
