widevine resourceId is missing


in js/constants/appConfig.js, there is no resourceId for widevine. thus it seems that https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/blob/master/js/state/contentSettings.js#L320 wouldn't actually work.
seems likely that either this is not enabling widevine at all (which i assume people would notice unless it only recently regressed) or itâ€™s actually enabling all plugins (which would be a security issue)
