This is a fix on 3.4 related to #26660.
See the comment from @stof here: #26660 (comment)

fixes a bug where custom providers would not be registered when retrieving the security.expression_language instance without the ExpressionVoter being instantiated.
avoids deprecations on 3.4 when using the 4.1 patch in #26660
