Unable to login


Prerequisites

 I am running the latest version. (up upgrade)
 I searched to see if the issue already exists.
 I inspected the verbose debug output with the -v, --verbose flag.
 Are you an Up Pro subscriber?

Description
Could not login after clicking confirmation link.
Steps to Reproduce
I'm trying to login to get Pro subscription. After running up team login, I receive confirmation email. Sign in page shows that I'm successfully logged in, but terminal waits for confirmation and fails with:
Error: login: requesting: Post https://teams.apex.sh/login: read tcp 192.168.0.106:52060->13.32.56.33:443: read: operation timed out
