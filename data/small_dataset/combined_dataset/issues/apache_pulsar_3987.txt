admin REST API serves 404 response to GET /admin/v2/tenants/{tenant} even though tenant exists


Describe the bug
The admin REST API returns a 404 Not Found response to GET /admin/v2/tenants/$TENANT even when GET /admin/v2/tenants shows that $TENANT exists.
To Reproduce
Using Pulsar 2.3.0:
# Create tenant with an empty request body
$ curl -X PUT http://host/admin/v2/tenants/foo

# List tenants shows the newly created tenant
$ curl -X GET http://host/admin/v2/tenants
["foo","public"]

# Trying to get the newly created tenant returns 404 Not Found
$ curl -X GET http://host/admin/v2/tenants/foo
{"reason":"Tenant does not exist"}

After I update the tenant so that it has a valid allowedClusters, the get request returns a 200 OK response:
$ curl -X POST -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"adminRoles":[],"allowedClusters":["mycluster"]}' http://host/admin/v2/tenants/foo

$ curl -X GET http://host/admin/v2/tenants/foo
{"adminRoles":[],"allowedClusters":["mycluster"]}


Expected behavior
I expect a 200 OK response with an empty response body, like
{"adminRoles":[],"allowedClusters":[]}
