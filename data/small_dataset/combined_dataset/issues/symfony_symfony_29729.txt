[Security] Use remember_me with json_login


Description
When using json_login authentication method, there is a boolean remember_me config key but this one is ignored for now. It would be wonderfull to be able to enable this feature, thus use it by passing a remember_me key in the body of the request.
Actual config:
security:
    firewalls:
        main:
            json_login:
                remember_me: true
            stateless: false
Example
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8000
Content-Type: application/json
cache-control: no-cache
{
	"username": "...",
	"password": "...",
	"remember_me": true
}
Remember_me key could be set as username and password:
security:
    firewalls:
        main:
            json_login:
                remember_me_path: remember_me
