Endpoint routing selecting incorrect controller/action after 2.0 -> 2.2 upgrade


Describe the bug
I ran into a scenario while migrating an app from 2.0 to 2.2. Basically a route that used to select a controller under an area, now is selecting a controller in the root controllers folder.
Here is a repro:
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace WebApplication1
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
        {
            app.UseMvc(routes =>
            {
                routes.MapRoute(
                    name: "areaRoute",
                    template: "{area:exists}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}");

                routes.MapRoute(
                    name: "accountsCatchAll",
                    template: "Accounts/{*path}",
                    defaults: new { area = "Accounts", controller = "Home", action = "Index" });

                routes.MapRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}

//Imagine this is in /WebApplication1/Controllers/HomeController.cs
namespace WebApplication1.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index() => Content("Home/Index");
    }
}

namespace WebApplication1.Areas.Accounts.Controllers
{
    //This is in /WebApplication1/Areas/Accounts/Controllers/HomeController.cs
    [Area("Accounts")]
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index() => Content("Accounts/Home/Index");
    }

    //This is in /WebApplication1/Areas/Accounts/Controllers/OtherController.cs
    [Area("Accounts")]
    public class OtherController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index() => Content("Accounts/Other/Index");
    }
}


Before using Endpoing Routing the url /accounts/forgot-username would match the "accountsCatchAll" and it would execute the HomeController under the "Accounts" area. After switching to endpoint routing the controller being picked up is the HomeController in the root controller folder (non-area controllers folder).
The issue goes away when I disable endpoint routing via:
services.AddMvc(options =>options.EnableEndpointRouting = false);
