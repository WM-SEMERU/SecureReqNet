Provide ARMv6l binaries


ARM is a quite popular for small computing clusters, and an interesting
pet project to try Nomad on.
Unfortunately, the current ARM builds don't run on Raspberry Pi's 1,
Zero or Zero W as it is compiled with some operations not available
there.
When executing the current binary, you receive this message:
Illegal instruction (core dumped)

The difference is caused by the version of the ARM instructions are
available on each version of the Pi.
| Version     | Compiler arch              |
|-------------+----------------------------|
| Pi v1, Zero | armel, floating point (v6) |
| Pi v2, v3   | armhf, floating point (v7) |
Fortunately, cross-compiling using Go is not so troublesome. It is possible to
produce an executable using the non-hf version of gcc.
This commit introduces a new make target for armel binaries. It renames the
previous one so it is clear the difference between artifacts versions.
A couple of extra compilation dependencies are needed on the build machine.
Tested armel o a Pi Zero W 1.3 and Pi 3, which executes, but there are not yet
any jobs running. The armel binary should work on all Raspberry Pi models,
while the armhf only works on Pi 2/3 and it is optimized.
Fixes #2517
