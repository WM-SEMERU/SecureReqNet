Set-HPOVNetworkSet Replaces networks. How do I add


When I use the Set-HPOVNetworkSet command, I can not find a good way to add new networks. I can get the networks uri from an exsisting network but I canâ€™t find a way to get exsisting and add new networks with the way get-hpovnetworkset outputs data. When I try to run set-hpovnetworkset with just new networks defined it over writes the exsisting config.
