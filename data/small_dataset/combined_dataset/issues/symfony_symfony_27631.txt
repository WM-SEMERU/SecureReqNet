[Security] Ability to set SameSite attribute for session and remember me cookie


Description
It would be useful if we could expose SameSite attribute for session and remember me cookie via yaml config.
Example
framework:
    session:
        name: NameOfTheCookie
        cookie_samesite: lax
security:
    firewalls:
        remember_me:
            name: NameOfTheCookie
            samesite: lax
Currently it's extremely painful to override it (unless I'm missing something?).
