For php-translation/symfony-bundle#295 the organization would like to make better use of the extendability of the bundle's Twig templates.
This PR wraps the metrics in a block in order to add metrics.
RfC: Another future enhancement would have to do with the extendability of the table, but the plan of approach for that (as it's rendered by a macro) has not been decided yet.
