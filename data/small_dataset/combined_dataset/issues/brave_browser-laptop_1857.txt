Password Settings should show password strength indicator instead of password length


Did you search for similar issues before submitting this one?
Yes
Describe the issue you encountered:
Brave's password manager shows all saved user/passwords for each site using asterisks. However, the actual number of asterisks is the actual length of the real password.
Expected behavior:
The password field should either not be shown OR password should be a fixed # of asterisks (so people standing behind a user don't know the exact number of chars for a password).

Platform (Win7, 8, 10? OS X? Linux distro?):
All versions
Brave Version:
All versions
Steps to reproduce:

Make sure you have some user/passwords saved
Go to about:passwords
Notice that the hidden passwords have the same number of asterisks as the actual password.
