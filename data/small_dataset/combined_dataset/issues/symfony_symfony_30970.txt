This adds "failure" transport support for messenger, so that messages that fail on all their retries can be collected in one spot and retried later if wanted:
framework:
    messenger:
        failure_transport: failed

        transports:
            async:
                dsn: 'amqp://'
            failed:
                dsn: 'doctrine://default?queue_name=failed'

        routing:
            'App\Message\SmsNotification': async
In this setup, SmsNotification would be retried 3 times on the async transport (current behavior) and then finally sent to the failed transport. The failed transport could be consumed like a normal transport, but it should usually be consumed with a new command: messenger:failed:retry, which interactively asks if you want to retry/reject a message:

As a bonus, the implementation re-uses the Worker class, which validates the extensibility of the system ðŸŽ† .
TODO:

 Finish messenger:failed:retry to retry by id
 Add messenger:failed:remove command to remove 1 or all
 Add messenger:failed:show command to show 1 or all
 Tests
 Possible WorkerFactory to avoid Worker instantiation duplication
 deprecation/BC problem with args to SendersLocator
 update CHANGELOG

Cheers!
