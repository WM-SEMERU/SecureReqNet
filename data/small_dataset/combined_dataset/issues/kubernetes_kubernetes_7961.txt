Run services as non-privileged users


At the moment most services in kubernetes run as root. This includes (from glancing at ps aux on a minion):

etcd
kube2sky
td-agent
skydns
elasticsearch
heapster

It's best practice to use non-root user accounts for services that don't need them. E.g. elasticsearch had remote code execution vulnerabilities in the past.
Even though docker's root has a capability bounding set applied so it doesn't translate to a real root on the host, the attack surface for privilege escalation attacks is still increased.
