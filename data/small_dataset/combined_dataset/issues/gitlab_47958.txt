### Problem to solve

The current output of the logs from `Gitlab::AppLogger` sent to `application.log` contain only free form text messages.  They should be updated to 

### Further details

Structuring the logs in `json` format and matching common attribute names, such as "user_id" and "remote_ip", will allow the logs to be used directly by custom tools and more easily consumed by existing tools such as ElasticSearch.

### Proposal

Update the `Gitlab::AppLogger` log messages to use a configuration similar to the  `lograge` for the `rails` log.

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

Success can be measured by GitLab's own use of the structured logs in their own internal logging infrastructure with a minimal amount of configuration.
