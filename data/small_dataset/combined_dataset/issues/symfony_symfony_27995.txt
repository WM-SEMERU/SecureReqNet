[Security][DX] Be able to know why exactly SecurityVoter returns false


Sometimes I find it hard to debug why is_granted returns true/false in some cases. I know there is at least one feature request (#26343) that tries to improve this, but #24501 inspired me to create this feature request.
It would be great to re-use the idea behind TransitionBlocker when using Voters. Instead of
if ($user->hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')) {
    return true;
}

one could write something like
if ($user->hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')) {
    yield new VoterBlocker('You need admin rights to do this');
}

This will make it easier to debug because the reason can be shown in the Profiler, but there should be a way to use this message to inform the user why it can't perform an action. Using is_granted sometimes feels like implementing "Computer says no" instead of "Sorry, you need to be an admin/this post is private/etc/".
