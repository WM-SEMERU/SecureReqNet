"support your favorite sites" banner is hard to understand


Description
A banner appears at the top of window, saying: "Hello! Ready to support your favorite sites? Brave will fill your wallet with tokens to get you started!", and there are three buttons: "No Thanks", "Maybe Later", and "I'm Ready". It seems like the user is being sold something, but without a sufficient explanation of what it is. My questions were: "What's my wallet?", "What is a token?", "How does this support sites that I might visit?" Without obvious answers, my choice is necessarily "No Thanks". Oughtn't there be some obvious way the user can inform themself?
Steps to Reproduce

Start Brave 0.23.105
I think I might have conducted a search from the navigation bar before the banner appeared.

Actual result:
Banner as described
Expected result:
Banner with a link to learn more or perhaps a "Learn More" button, at the risk of adding a fourth button.
Reproduces how often:
I haven't tried to reproduce it with a fresh install, but I imagine every user who installs Brave and starts it sees this.
