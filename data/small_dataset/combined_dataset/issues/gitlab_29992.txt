'There was a security release for Nokogiri a few days ago and `bundler audit` is now failing on `master` because of that.

I've started working on the upgrade but:

- [x] `gollum-lib` depends on Nokogiri `~> 1.6.4` but Nokogiri `1.7.0` [drops the support of Ruby 1.9.2, 1.9.3, and 2.0.0](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#backwards-incompatibilities) and `gollum-lib` [advertise its support of Ruby 1.9.3](https://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib#system-requirements)
  - [x] I've opened https://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib/pull/243 to update the Gem dependency
  - [ ] Wait for a 5.x release of `gollum-lib`: https://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib/milestone/3
- `omniauth-cas3` depends on Nokogiri `~> 1.6.6`
  - [x] I've opened https://github.com/tduehr/omniauth-cas3/pull/2 to update the Gem dependency
  - [x] Wait for a new release of `omniauth-cas3`
- `truncato` needs to be updated to `0.7.9` since `0.7.8` depends on Nokogiri `~> 1.6.1`
