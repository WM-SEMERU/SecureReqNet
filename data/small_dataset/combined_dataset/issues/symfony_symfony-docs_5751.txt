SecurityBundle logout.target is not needed / not documented?


I was mislead by the SecurityBundle Full Default Configuration, showing the option
security:
    firewalls:
        somename:
            logout:
                target: /
which I interpreted as path or route-name, to which will be redirected on logout.
I got a solution at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32902400/symfony-logout-target-never-applied, it's working great. But somebody with deeper knowledge than me should document this configuration option or probably remove it, if it's no longer in use?
