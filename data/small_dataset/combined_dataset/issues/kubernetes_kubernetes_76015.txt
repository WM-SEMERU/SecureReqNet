HPA not fetching custom metric of another deployment than the scale target


Hello, I cannot make HPA work with a custom metric from another deployment than the scale target.
I get this error:
ScalingActive  False   FailedGetObjectMetric  the HPA was unable to compute the replica count: unable to get metric my_controller_metric: Deployment on work my-controller-deployment/unable to fetch metrics from custom metrics API: the server could not find the metric my_controller_metric for deployments

It works like a charm when worker pods emit their own scaling metric though, but this isn't what I want to achieve.
The spec I made for the HPA uses an Object definition to fetch the custom metric in question.
According to the doc (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/):

[object metrics] describe a different object in the same namespace, instead of describing pods.

My understanding is that this seems to be what I need, since the HPA, the scale target deployment and the deployment providing the metrics are all working in the same namespace.
You will find all the details related to this issue on the Stackoverflow question.
I am using:
Server: v1.11.7-gke.12
Go: go1.10.8b4
autoscaling/v2beta1
custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1
Prometheus
