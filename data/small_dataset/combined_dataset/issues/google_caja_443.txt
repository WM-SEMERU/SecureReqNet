Eliminate uses of == and != in caja.js


Original issue 443 created by collin.jackson on 2008-06-09T23:42:57.000Z:
This line in isJSONContainer in caja.js should use === instead of ==:
if (obj == null) { return false; } // Match null and undefined
Also, tameException uses == in a three places where === would be better.
There are also != in five places: fastPathEnum, fastPathRead,
fastPathCall, fastPathSet, fastPathDelete. These should probably be !==.
It might be worth auditing other files as well.
