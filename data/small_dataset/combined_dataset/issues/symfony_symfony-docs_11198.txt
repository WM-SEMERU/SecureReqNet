Update unit_testing.rst


While following the tutorial changing the property from $controllerResolver to $resolver generated a bug because in previous example from httpkernel in the file the property was called like this
$controller = $this->controllerResolver->getController($request);
It is not a fix but it could help the people that follow the tutorial not get stuck 👍
