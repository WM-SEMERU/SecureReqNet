[3.0] Form component documentation says to use classes SessionCsrfProvider and DefaultCsrfProvider, which were removed in 3.0


In documentation of form component for 3.0 version the whole CSRF Protection is wrong:
http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/form/introduction.html#csrf-protection
Classes SessionCsrfProvider and DefaultCsrfProvider were removed from Form Component in 3.0
https://github.com/symfony/form/blob/2.8/Extension/Csrf/CsrfProvider/DefaultCsrfProvider.php#L14
