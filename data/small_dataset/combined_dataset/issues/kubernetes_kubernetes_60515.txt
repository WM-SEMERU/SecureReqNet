[1.8] Automated cherry pick of #58720 #57326 #60342


Cherry pick of #58720 #57326 #60342 on release-1.8.
#58720: Ensure that the runtime mounts RO volumes read-only
#57326: Update Dashboard version to v1.8.3
#60342: Fix nested volume mounts for read-only API data volumes
Fixes #60814 for 1.8
Note for reviewers:
The Dashboard update is necessary because previous versions of the Dashboard attempted to write to the secret volume on startup, and so the read-only secret volume change prevented the Dashboard from starting.
Changes secret, configMap, downwardAPI and projected volumes to mount read-only, instead of allowing applications to write data and then reverting it automatically. Until version 1.11, setting the feature gate ReadOnlyAPIDataVolumes=false will preserve the old behavior. Updates dashboard version to v1.8.3 to avoid writing to read-only locations.
