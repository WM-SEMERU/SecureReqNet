[18.09 backport] Switch to go 1.11


Whitespace changes are caused by the fact that gofmt from go-1.11
uses a different heuristic as to how to format the file, making
the source code that was OK for go-1.10 causing a warning with
go-1.11.
NOTE this whitespace change makes the gofmt from go-1.10 complain,
so please upgrade your golang.
