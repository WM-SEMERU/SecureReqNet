CLOUDSTACK-9977: Enhance SSL protocol used by Console Proxy


Current SSL protocol and ciphers used in SystemVMs are not the recommended. One can verify this with tests such as the one from SSL Labs (https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). The grade was capped to C because of SSL ciphers and protocol. The grade was capped to B because it was allowed to use Diffie-Hellman keys with size lesser than 2048 bits. This commit changes the grade from C to A-.
The following image shows the test result before any changes.

After including the changes from this commit the test result was A-.
