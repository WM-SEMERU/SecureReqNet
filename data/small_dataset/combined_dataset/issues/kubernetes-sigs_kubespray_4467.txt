Using multus with more than one CNI


BUG REPORT or I miss something (choose one):
When using multus - the kubespray framework deploy the network-plugin and then pass it to multus to use as the default CNI.
There are some cases where a pod might need,  say, 3 networks, each from a different CNI.
For example: flannel for the first, macvlan for some storage network and calico for another use.
In that case adding these CNI to the multus CRD is not enough cause these extra CNI might need some kind of deployment (Daemonset etc...)
I see at least three options to address this issue:

I overlooked something and the solution is there
bake all other CNI configuration into multus daemonset yaml
add role similar to network-plugin, say, extra-multus-network-plugin
