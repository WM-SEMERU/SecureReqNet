This adds a sync:// transport that just calls the handlers immediately. Why? This allows you to route your messages to some "async" transport. But then, when developing locally or running your tests, you can choose to run them synchronously instead:
# config/packages/messenger.yaml
framework:
    messenger:
        transports:
            async: '%env(MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN)%'
        routing:
            'App\Message\SmsNotification': async
            'App\Message\OtherMessage': async
# .env
# by default, handle this sync
MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN=sync://

# .env.local on production (or set this via real env vars)
# on production, use amqp
MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN=amqp://.......

Cheers!
