### Problem to solve

A user should be able to filter issues based on whether the issue is confidential or not.

### Further details

Currently, issues can not be filtered by whether they are confidential or not.

### Proposal

Implement a filter for `confidential:true` similar to the other issue filters.  `confidential:true` and `confidential:false` should be available.  `present` and `yes` should be accepted as synonyms for `true`

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

Usage data and traffic will show use of the `confidential` filter.

### Links / references


This is related to #17326, which focused on search visibility and #29784 which has a scope much larger then this MVC.
