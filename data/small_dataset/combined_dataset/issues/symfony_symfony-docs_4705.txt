Improve the SecurityFactoryInterface documentation


This was initially opened by @LangJ on the code repository in symfony/symfony#10870:

The methods of the SecurityFactoryInterface do not have any comments. It would be helpfull if there were comments describing how the methods should be implemented and how the are used.
http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/cookbook/security/custom_authentication_provider.html
is describing the Interface a bit, but especially the signature of the create method is unclear.
