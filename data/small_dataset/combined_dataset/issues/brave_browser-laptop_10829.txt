Blocking rules are not limited to private tabs

Describe the issue you encountered:
  12) Bravery Panel Adblock stats iframe tests detects blocked elements in iframe in private tab:
     Promise was rejected with the following reason: timeout
  Error

So what is happening here is that you set ad blocking rule in private tab and this rule is applied outside private tab as well.
Is this something that is intended? cc @diracdeltas
