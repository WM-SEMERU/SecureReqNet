Ability to avoid session creation for anonymous page hit (with patch)


Description
Sites (with statefull Firewall) with secured area always start session for any anonymous hit of url in secured area. This is related to PathTrait feature. Every hit generate a session which store initial URL (PathTrait) that may be used later to redirect user to initial page after authentication. But in the case that this was a bot/anonymous/DoS hit the session just left in session storage for it lifetime.
It may be good to avoid such behavour for non-standart authentication schemes and DoS tolerance.
Proposed solution is to introduce earlySession(): bool function in AuthenticationEntryPointInterface which must be consulted everytime when making decision of creating (storing data in) anonymous  session. At this time only saveTargetPath == savePathTrait affected.
The earlySession() function is:
+    /**
+     * Returns whether to start session before authentication.
+     *
+     * The true value means to start session and enable PathTrait feature (ability to
+     * redirect/forward user to initially hitted page after authentication).
+     *
+     * The false value mean no session start (disabling PathTrait feature)
+     * before authentication avoiding generating and storing session for anonymous
+     * page hit.
+     *
+     * @return bool
+     */
+    public function earlySession();

Example
In case of earlySession implementation avoiding session start will look like this:
class MyAuthenticator extends AbstractGuardAuthenticator {
...
    /*
      disable session for anonymous
    */
    public function earlySession()
    {
      return false;
    }

...
}
