[cookbook/csrf_in_login_form] Confusion around csrf_token_generator and csrf_provider for form_login


In the docs for 2.7 under the form_login is csrf_token_generator. In docs for 2.8 there is a note that csrf_token_generator was introduced in 2.4. In docs for 2.6 there is csrf_provider.
When using  csrf_token_generator in symfony 2.7 we are getting exception:
InvalidConfigurationException in ArrayNode.php line 309: Unrecognized option "csrf_token_generator" under "security.firewalls.main.form_login"

Moreover in the docs for FosUserBundle there is a comment in yml
# if you are using Symfony < 2.8, use the following config instead:
# csrf_provider: form.csrf_provider

It confuses a lot. I assume that csrf_token_generator was introduced in 2.8. Is that right?
