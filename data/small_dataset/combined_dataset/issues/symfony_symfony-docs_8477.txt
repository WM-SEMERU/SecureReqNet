Deprecated ACL


This fixes #8433. I've left some mentions to ACLs because they are deprecated, not removed:

Best Practices mentions them: https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/security.html#authorization-i-e-denying-access
Security config reference includes the acl: section: https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/security.html
