VpcNetwork.import does not default subnet names correctly


Posted on Gitter:
const vpc = VpcNetwork.import(this, 'VpcSviluppo', {
      vpcId: 'vpc-0e0311c34e5d7c8ac',
      availabilityZones: ['eu-west-1a','eu-west-1b','eu-west-1c'],
      publicSubnetIds: [
        'subnet-0c2fda469e286aa78',
        'subnet-030da2fd20cae22b3',
        'subnet-0dd5750486e28414d'
      ]
    });
Leads to:
Error: There are no 'Public' subnets in this VPC. Use a different VPC subnet selection.

The subnet group name should have defaulted to Public, but it didn't.
