[Form] Exclude templates with form_theme


I have multiple form themes configured in my twig.yaml:
twig:
    form_themes:
        - 'bootstrap_4_layout.html.twig'
        - 'form/form_row.html.twig'
        - 'form/form_checkbox_radio.html.twig'
        - 'form/errors.html.twig'
I need to exclude one of these templates (form/form_checkbox_radio.html.twig) for a single form field. Because form_theme adds templates by default, I need to use the only flag:
{% form_theme form.someField with [
    'bootstrap_4_layout.html.twig',
    'form/form_row.html.twig',
    'form/errors.html.twig',
] only %}
{{ form_row(form.someField) }}
One small annoyance is that, since I must use the only flag to remove a template, I need to repeat all the templates that I have specified in my twig.yaml file. If I were to add one more template I'll need to go to all the places where this happened and add the new template. This is error prone.
What would be nice is something like this:
{% form_theme form.someField with not ['template_i_want_to_remove.html.twig'] %}
{{ form_row(form.someField) }}
If at the same time you need to add another template, you could do this:
{% form_theme form.someField with ['template_i_want_to_add.html.twig'] not ['template_i_want_to_remove.html.twig'] %}
{{ form_row(form.someField) }}
The syntax is debatable.
