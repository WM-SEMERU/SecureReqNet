Access denied even after new role added


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2
Description
I am building an affiliation system in my app. After user registered as an affiliate a new ROLE_AFFILIATE is added to the user. But user is denied access to route even after updating the isEqualeTo method. I have to logout first then login again in order to get things work.
Thanks you !
