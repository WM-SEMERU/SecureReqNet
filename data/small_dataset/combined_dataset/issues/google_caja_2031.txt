Error while processing the html


Hi. I'm getting the error while parsing some kinds of html markdown. Here is simple example:
<a href="
#somehhref
">link</a>

That snippet can be copied to https://caja.appspot.com/ after pressing Cajole getting the error:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'hasScheme' of null

at
ses-single-frame.js?debug=1:32638

The reason of that error is \n after href parameter. As quick workaround I can single lined that html and it works fine, but there is side effect with other htmls (for example with <pre> tag)
