Consider not handling YAML in APIserver


The APIserver processes JSON and YAML.
A vulnerability in the apiserver would be critical.
Compared to JSON:

YAML has a crazy complicated SPEC.
YAML has a go implementation that is more complex

14KLOC JSON vs 30KLOC YAML


YAML has fewer tests in the go implementation

8KLOC JSON vs 2.5KLOC YAML


Has a track record of vulnerabilities

YAML has fewer vulnerabilities, but this may be due to its less widespread use in critical software
24 CVEs match YAML vs 66 JSON, using http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search



Therefore we should consider one of the following changes:

Do not process YAML in the apiserver itself:

Convert YAML to JSON in clients
Recommend that users needing to use YAML via curl, etc, can pipe YAML through simple yaml to json converter tool.


Convert YAML to JSON in a less privileged proxy process (which does not have access to etcd).
