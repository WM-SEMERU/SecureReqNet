Allow separate truststore conf for HttpEmitter


This PR allows the HttpEmitter and ParametrizedUriEmitter to use a different SSLContext from the one injected by the logic introduced in #4270.
The HttpEmitter can use the default Java SSLContext or a truststore specified through configuration.
This can be useful in situations where it's inconvenient or forbidden by policy to keep all certificates in the same truststore.
For example, suppose the server certificate used by Druid nodes for internal communications is signed by a root cert that is not present in the default Java truststore, but the metrics receiver uses a certificate signed by a major CA, which is present in the default Java truststore, and the user wishes to keep the non-major CA signed cert in a separate truststore.
