Hovered-over elements are not highlighted after switching tab with keyboard


Description
After switching between tabs using the keyboard (using Ctrl+Page Up/Page Down), elements that happen to be underneath the cursor do not have the CSS :hover effect applied to them.
This causes minor confusion/uncertainty because I do not know if I will click at the intended element on the website.
Steps to Reproduce

Open DuckDuckGo in two different tabs.
Hover the cursor over the magnifying glass so that it gets a green background.
Switch to the other tab using a keyboard shortcut without moving the cursor.

Actual result:
The magnifying glass does not have a green background, as if the cursor is not hovering over it.
Expected result:
The magnifying glass has a green background.
Reproduces how often:
100% of the time.
