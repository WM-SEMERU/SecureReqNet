Implement site ownership verification


There are three options to verify ownership (quote stefan from IRC)
1) /somerandomfile.txt
2) a DNS TXT record on www.foo.com
3) A header like X-Minion-Site-Ownership

The first step is a module that does each individual verification.
Asssuming an unique code is generated and we need to check such code exist in either option.
