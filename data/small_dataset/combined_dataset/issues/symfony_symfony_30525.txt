Replaces #30523 with a rebase to master.
This PR changes how property metadata is cached, significantly reducing the number of calls made between PHP and the backend cache. Instead of storing one cache item per method and set of arguments, a single cache item is stored per method. This matches well with real-world use, where most properties in an object will need to be inspected.
Note that the absolute numbers in the above PR are best case. In production environments where memcache is on a remote server, we were seeing multiple seconds consumed by memcache calls.
