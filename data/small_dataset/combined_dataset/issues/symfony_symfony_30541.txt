Client is very generic and used in 3 places: BrowserKit, HttpKernel, and FramewrokBundle. Each Client extends another one. So, to make things clearer, I'd like to rename Client to Browser like this:
Symfony\Component\BrowerKit\Client -> AbstractBrowser
Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Client -> HttpKernelBrowser
Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Client -> KernelBrowser
The next PR will introduce an HttpBrowser based on the new HttpClient component :)
