I updated recently the WebTestCase with a check to provide a better/more clear exception message (see #30479). After that change @fabpot renamed different Client classes in components to a clearer name (for ex Client in HttpKernel is now KernelBrowser etc.). This PR aims to replace the Client in WebTestCase to the new name class name.
