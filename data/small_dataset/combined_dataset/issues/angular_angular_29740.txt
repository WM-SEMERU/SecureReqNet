perf(ivy): ngcc - exit early if the targeted package has been compiled


This is a quick fix for webpack but there are more optimisations to be achieved on the
first time run by replacing the TS module resolver for the initial walk of the tree.
Previously we always walked the whole folder tree looking for
entry-points before we tested whether a target package had been
processed already. This could take >10secs!
This commit does a quick check of the target package before doing
the full walk which brings down the execution time for ngcc in this
case dramatically.
