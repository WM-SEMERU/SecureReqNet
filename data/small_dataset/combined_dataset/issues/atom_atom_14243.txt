Allows atom to open local files by URL scheme


Description of the Change
The change allows the editor to open local files based on a URL handler. This functionality is common in other editors, such as sublime and emacs
Alternate Designs
No alternates. Some people have suggested using the 'atom:' scheme, however that is already in use for packages. WizardOfOgz has made a script to act like a wrapper around atom, essentially translating a URI scheme to a file and passing it to atom.
Some notable discussions requesting such a feature:

Why Should This Be In Core?
This can not be implemented in a package as it is, by design, core behaviour.
Benefits
This shall allow files to be opened by URL.
Possible Drawbacks
None.
Applicable Issues
In my personal use-case, I will be using the PHP Whoops package to handle exceptions in web-development. It will present me with a page with a URL to the file/line/column which I can then click and it will open it straight in the atom editor at the exact point at which the error occured.
Still to be done
