When snippets feature visibility is set to `Disabled` or `Only team members` it is still possible for any user to access them through the API.

Other places `SnippetsFinder` is used also have this problem so the snippets appear in `/explore/snippets` too.

Also check `Snippet.accessible_to` used in `Search::SnippetService`.
