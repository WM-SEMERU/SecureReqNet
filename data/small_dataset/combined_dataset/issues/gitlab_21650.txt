'### Summary

GitLab sends "project access requested" emails to blocked users. 

### Steps to reproduce

* Set a user in a group to be "blocked"
* Have another user request access to a group the blocked user is a developer for

### Expected behavior

No emails should be sent to a blocked user

### Actual behaviour

An email is sent to the blocked user. This discloses both the requestor's details, and the details of all other group members (in the To: header).

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots
Here's the email I got (suitably redacted)

### Possible fixes

Assuming blocked users should not get any emails, ever, then this should just be an additional filter + check in `app/services/notification_service.rb`, but I haven't checked yet.
