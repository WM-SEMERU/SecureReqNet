Increase Test Coverage of sparse_merkle_tree_test.go


The inclusion proof tests in sparse_merkle_tree_test.go do not exercise any validation logic.
Ideally, we could instantiate these tests with an in-memory tree implementation and verify with the verifiers in client.
Since mocks are not recommended in Go, this would also bring the tests better in-line with best practice.
