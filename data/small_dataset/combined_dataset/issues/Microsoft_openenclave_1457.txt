Evaluate moving to mbedTLS v2.16 branch


mbedTLS has designated its latest update v2.16.0 as of 2018-12-21 the new long-term stable production branch. We should evaluate the impact of moving to this new release:

 Reconcile breaking changes in the API surface with OE SDK use
 Evaluate whether this poses issues for link-time mbedTLS replacement for projects using mbedTLS updated with Everest TLS crypto.
 Evaluate cost-benefit of moving to 2.16
 Determine if 2.7 branch is being EOL and timeframe for that.
 Request OSS SDL security review of new mbedTLS version.
