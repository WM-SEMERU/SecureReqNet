refactor(core): static-query schematic should check templates


Queries can technically be also accessed within component templates
e.g.
<my-comp [binding]="myQuery"></my-comp>
In that case the query with the property "myQuery" is accessed
statically and needs to be marked with static: true. There are
other edge cases that need to be handled as the template property
read doesn't necessarily resolve to the actual query property.
For example:
<foo #myQuery></foo>
<my-comp [binding]="myQuery"></my-comp>
In this scenario the binding doesn't refer to the actual query
because the template reference variable takes precedence. The
query doesn't need to be marked with "static: true" this time.
This commit ensures that the static-query migration schematic
now handles this cases properly. Also template property reads
that access queries from within a <ng-template> are ignored
as these can't access the query before the view has been initialized.
Note: Blocked on #29688
Resolves FW-1216
