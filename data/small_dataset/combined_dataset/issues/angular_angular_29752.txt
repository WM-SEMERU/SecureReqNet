What is the current behavior?
Copying the example, mentioned at Activated Route (https://angular.io/api/router/ActivatedRoute), to Stackblitz doesn't compile: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-x7pbeb?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhello.component.ts
That's because the example does not use .pipe.
Issue Number: N/A
What is the new behavior?
I've updated the example to include pipe.

 No
