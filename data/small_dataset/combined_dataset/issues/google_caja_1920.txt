Caja does not strip downlevel-revealed conditional comments [possible fix included]


Original issue 1922 created by morgan.anthony on 2014-06-19T14:50:25.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
svn HEAD - all platforms
What steps will reproduce the problem?
var example = caja.makeSaxParser({
pcdata : function(x) { if (/vml/.test(x)) throw new Error("not stripping downlevel-revealed conditional") },
});
example('<![if !vml]>foo<![endif]>');
What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It throws the exception. It shouldn't if caja is to handle (drop) these, admittedly, annoying junk tags.
Please provide any additional information below.

these are pretty common in emails, which is the use case I'm looking at here.
I've "fixed" this issue by changing:
    case '&lt;\!':
      if (!/^\w/.test(next)) {
        if (h.pcdata) {

to:
    case '&lt;\!':
      if (!/^(\w|\[)/.test(next)) {
        if (h.pcdata) {

In parseCPS function, to catch it along with doctype declarations and the like. But of course I'm not sure that's right, having only a cursory understanding of the code.
I tried to run the tests, but seemingly did not have enough memory on this machine!
