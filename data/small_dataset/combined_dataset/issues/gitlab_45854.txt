### Summary

The authentication banner displays the message "Please sign in to create the new issue" when a private projects new issues URI is accessed in an unauthenticated manner.  

### Impact

Impact on it's own is minor, however, when combined with an vulnerability such as !45689, it could be used for targeted private project contents disclosure.

### Steps to reproduce

Directly access a private projects `/issues/new` URL from a new private browsing window: https://gitlab.com/asaba/dotfiles/issues/new

### Example Project

Any private project.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The blue "Please sign in to create the new issue" is shown, indicating the existence of a private project.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The generic red "You must log in to continue" banner should be shown to the user for any attempted unauthenticated access.
