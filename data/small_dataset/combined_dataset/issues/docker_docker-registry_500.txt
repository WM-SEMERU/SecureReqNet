Define health-check endpoints for pingdom / monitoring


The idea is: expose an (multiple?) endpoint(s) that does health checks (on the backend / system / whatever / to be defined) so we can hook pingdom or another system into that.
Need to explore pingdom possibilities first (authentication, custom headers, body processing).
Then need to decide what we want.
