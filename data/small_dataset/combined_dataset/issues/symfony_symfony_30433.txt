PercentType symbol option
As of this writing, Symfony will forcibly append a percentage sign (%) to all input fields that are of the PercentType form type. This PR will introduce a boolean flag called symbol that, when false, will not display the percentage sign. Each of the default layouts that define percent_widget will respect this option. You could also use a customised string as value for symbol option.
By default, this new option will be set to true so that it maintains backward compatibility. The unit tests have been updated where appropriate, and a new unit test has been added (as appropriate).
