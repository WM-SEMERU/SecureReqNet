Update Python and Flask usage in Compose tutorial



Uses the modern Python 3.7 image, as 3.4 is EOL.
Use COPY instead of ADD, since behavior of ADD is not used, as recommended in the Dockerfile reference.
Separates copying and installing requirements from copying project, to make rebuilds more efficient if no requirements change.
Uses the recommended flask run command. This is especially needed on Windows, where app.py incorrectly looks like an executable file when copying into Docker. pallets/werkzeug#1482
Uses the FLASK_ENV env var to control development mode (debugger, reloader). This is only set when demonstrating the volumes option for live updating files, as it should not be used in production. Note that the development server (flask run, app.run()) should not be used in production either, but I think that's outside the scope of this change.
