Make it possible to block Trackers only


Now on windows you only have option to either enable or disabled ads/tracking blocking.
A lot of people of us want to use ublock orgin for blocking adds because superior speed but still want to rely on brave anti-tracking, to avoid the need using apps like Ghostery.
In the Brave android app it is possible to disabled adblocking but enable anti-trackers.
