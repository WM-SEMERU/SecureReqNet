validate user-controlled Buffer input


src/controllers/helper.js calls Buffer(header.signature, 'hex'). If a malicious user supplies a number as the header signature, this method returns header.signature bytes of uninitialized memory. While this is not a problem on its own, this could potentially lead to unintended memory disclosure (for instance, if we return an error to the user that includes the signature seen by the server).
The same issue arises from Buffer(user.publicKey) if the user-supplied public key isn't validated.
solution - validate input types before initializing the buffer.
