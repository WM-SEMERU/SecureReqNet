Does the issue resolve itself when disabling Brave Shields?

No


Is the issue reproducible on the latest version of Chrome?

No. Chromium (71.0.3576.0, not Brave) behaves correctly.



Additional Information
Also tested with GitHub, Google, and Login.gov (which uses WebAuthn) with the same results.
I installed regular Brave just to test, so it's a fresh install.
I am also aware of #324, but unlike that issue, there are no errors in the console and prompts seem to run forever or until they time out instead of being interrupted.
