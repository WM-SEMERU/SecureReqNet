[SECURITY] AbstractAuthenticationListener.php error instead info.


[2018-09-13 20:43:38] security.INFO: Authentication request failed. {"exception":"[object] (Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\AuthenticationServiceException(code: 0): An exception occurred while executing
 ...
 Doctrine\\DBAL\\Driver\\PDOException(code: 42S22): SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 't0.phone' in 'field list' at

Definitely I think this is NOT info, but error.
And since it's info, it's not logged in production because of fingers_crossed with action_level: error - so to actually see the real error behind Authentication request could not be processed due to a system problem. I had to debug on production. Very bad practice IMHO.
