Add subprojects for committees


Not sure if we officially say that committees can have subprojects, but I noticed steering as a subproject for sig-arch after creating #3437: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture#subprojects.
Technically, committees also own repos (and thus "code") so I guess it makes sense to list these as subprojects?
