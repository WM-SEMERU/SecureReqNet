hack/local-up-cluster.sh fails with kubelet reporting "server.go:160] unknown command"


The master branch is failing now. The error was because when staring the kubelet, the local-up-cluster.sh script ran:
hyperkube kubelet '' --v=3...
The '' was interpreted as non-flag arguments and caused the kubelet to fail.
