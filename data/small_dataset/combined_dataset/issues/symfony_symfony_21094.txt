(Note: I didn't wanted to create this PR now on master but on my fork ðŸ˜ž, so it's still a bit work in progress).
This is a proposal of a new feature on Voters, the goal is to provide a way for a voter to do a kind of reporting why it choose this decision at a specific context.
For example on of our project, we use voters but we liked to know which voter and why was against this action and report it through a response or any kind. This can be used also in the profiler for some debugging.
PS: I will fill more this description soon, feed backs are welcome to continue this or not
