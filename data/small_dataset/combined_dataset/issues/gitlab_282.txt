We are running gitlab with one of many projects at (anonymised) http://gitlab.ourdomain.com:8081/project.git

From netbeans 7.3, using the integrated git tools, doing commit/push works well with either http (+ gitlab username/password) or using ssh key.

BUT, once you make a push using http, the relevant objects in the repo for that project have their ownership and permissions changed:
drwxr-xr-x  2 gitlab git

Subsequently, other users trying to push by ssh+key can no longer push and get an error: 
"error occurred during unpacking on the remote end: unpack-object abnormal exit"

If I change the repo url/method in my own netbeans client back to using ssh again, the problem persists.

There is a workaround to chown git:git all the files in the project repo/objects and chmod to 770. But this doesnt seem the right thing to do.

I searched for this before I posted, apologies if its a duplication of another issue.

Cheers
Gavin
