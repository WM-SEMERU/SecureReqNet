Symfony version
3.4.8



Yesterday I have upgraded from 3.4.6 to 3.4.8 and the API (Symfony + FOSRestBundle) throws error:

You must either make the "AppBundle:User" entity Doctrine Repository ("Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository") implement "Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Security\User\UserLoaderInterface" or set the "property" option in the corresponding entity provider configuration.

The problem is that I don't use anywhere UserLoaderInterface or loadUserByUsername method since I have custom solutions. Anybody knows how to make it work again? Symfony v3.4.6 works fine and no such error is thrown.
