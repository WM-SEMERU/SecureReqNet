Support KDBX4 and Argon2


KeePass will have Argon2 password derivation function soon, instead of AES-based one. As WebCrypto doesn't provide built-in Argon2, we have to build it using asm.js and switch to WebAssembly, once it's supported.

Bad news here is that most probably we'll be a lot slower than desktop app.
