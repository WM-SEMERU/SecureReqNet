Issue Title
asp.net core Authentication middleware return 401/403 with a valid token
General
Our api use built-in middleware from .net core to validate tokens. We have a valid token returned by AAD and service-to service call (JwtBearerAuthentication ) always return 401 while visit the app in a browser (CookieAuthentication) middle ware always return 403.
The exact same code is running on two slots with two separate AAD app and both have been running for a while. One of the two started to have the above mentioned issue and the only change happened was for the AAD app that has the issue, it was switched to multi-tent app and new service principles were created briefly. All these changes were reverted and the service principles were deleted as well. However, that does not solve the problem.
For the cookie authentication:
builder.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions 
            {
                AutomaticAuthenticate = true,
            });
For JwtBearerOptions:
JwtBearerOptions jwtBearerOptions = new JwtBearerOptions
            {
                AutomaticAuthenticate = true,
                AutomaticChallenge = true,
                Authority = string.Format(jwtSettings.SignInAuthority, jwtSettings.Tenant),
               TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
                {
                    ValidateAudience = true,
                    ValidAudiences = jwtSettings.Audiences
                };
                TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters {
                    ValidateIssuer = true,
                    ValidIssuer = jwtSettings.Issuer
                }
            };
