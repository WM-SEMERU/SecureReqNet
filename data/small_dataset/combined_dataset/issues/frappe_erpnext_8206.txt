Integrate Captcha for Signup, Contact Us and Other Public Forms


Hi all,
When in use, Signup, Contact Us and any other public webform form without Captcha presents a good opportunity for bot attacks.
How can we have in-built Captcha integration for Signup and Contact Us pages as a basic security measure?
Note: This issue was raised back in 2012 but was closed with no roadmap.
