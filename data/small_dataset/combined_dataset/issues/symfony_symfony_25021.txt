yes


Symfony version
3.4 ? maybe also before



In the sulu recipe, we will add another file which adds the firewall to the existing configuration. This is not really possible without manually adding the admin key inside the security.yaml file!
@stof hopefully you will add your thought which we have at the #SymfonyConHackday2017
