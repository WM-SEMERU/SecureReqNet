I propose to improve the performance of the ObjectNormalizer by not adding a new interface to the PropertyAccess component, but by adding some shortcut for cases where we know that we do not need to perform all checks. The added benefit is that this will not only speed up the ObjectNormalizer class, but will be available for every consumer of the PropertyAccessor without having to adapt to a new API.
TODO:

 confirm that these changes indeed introduce the same benefit as #29405 doing an actual benchmark
