do browsers run event handlers at safe points?


Original issue 1070 created by felix8a on 2009-07-09T20:50:01.000Z:
in firefox 3, calling el.focus() appears to call el's onfocus event handler
before el.focus() returns.  this is somewhat surprising, and it's not
clear what other event handlers might get run at that time.
like, does it also call other.blur()?  will pending mousemoves fire?
will pending timers fire?  etc.

are browsers allowed to run js event handlers as interrupts
at arbitrary points in a js script?  if so, domita might need to
have its own machinery for deferring execution of event handlers
until a safe point.
are browsers allowed to run js event handlers during calls to
browser functions?  if so, domita needs to be checked for
reentrancy problems.
