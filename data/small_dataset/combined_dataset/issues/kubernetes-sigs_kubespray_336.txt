Use etcd to store configurations/secrets


Currently there is a 'rsync' between nodes or between deploy-host and nodes
As we want to achieve self-provisioning (aka pull), nodes need to get configuration from somewhere, and as discuted in #320 etcd seems a good place.
This task as no dependency, we can  switch to this mode (etcd as cluster-configuration datastore) asap.
Configuration to share:
Ansible conf

 inventory
 group_vars

tokens

certs
