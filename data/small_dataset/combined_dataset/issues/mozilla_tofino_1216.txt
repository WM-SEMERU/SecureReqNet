Restrict access to the UA service


This is a ticket for discussion and prioritization.
The UA service stores some amount of data.
It can also take actions: sending commands to the frontend and touching the disk and network.
In theory, there's no need to protect it — an application running on your machine has already pwned you. But in practice that's not quite the case, and things get even more worrying if we store passwords in the UA service. This post sums up the issue nicely.
At some point we should consider some of the following:

Mutual authentication between the UA service and the frontend. We don't want arbitrary apps, or indeed arbitrary web apps, being able to make requests to the service. This might involve using the Keychain on Mac (as described here).
Having the UA service store only ciphertext. For example: the frontend could use OS security to store a key, and encrypt passwords for storage.
Having the UA service itself produce permission/pairing dialogs in some circumstances. ("Tofino wants access to your passwords. Allow?")
Taking the usual sane precautions: make sure the UA service only binds to the loopback interface, for example.
