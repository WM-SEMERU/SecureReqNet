Regression testing for security defaults, from zero


Security changes are very difficult to track.  We've discussed deployment rework #5472 , as part of that, maybe

we need a security-util.sh script, which does all the security tasks
this script should be used in hack/local-up-cluster.sh, and
hack/local-up-cluster.sh should run in the CI

This way if security options change/regress, they are always caught.  Likewise, we will know that a single node example cluster always spins up and works no matter what config changes happen in the code base.  Since hack/local-up is so fast, it wont be super hard to add this.  I always just do sudo pkill -e kube* ; sudo pkill -e etcd* ; sudo hack/local-up-cluster.sh, it takes about 20 seconds or less.
