SELinux: Kubelet directory should not have to be labeled svirt_sandbox_file_t


Currently, the Kubelet directory has to be labeled svirt_sandbox_file_t on systems using SELinux.  This is disadvantageous because the svirt_sandbox_file_t type is usable from any container -- meaning that a container process escaping its namespace isolation will be able to use any file or directory with that type.  We can make Kubernetes more secure on systems using SELinux by allowing the Kubelet directory to be labeled with a type unusable from a container (like var_lib_t).
Some users have tried this; there are a couple bugs that need to be fixed; the following are not currently usable when the Kubelet directory is not labeled as svirt_sandbox_file_t.

Termination message
Hosts file
Secrets and EmptyDir memory medium

Users work around these by either making containers privileged (which means, in Docker, that they run as unconfined_t) or enabling permissive mode, both of which lessen the security of the system.
