Checked on 3.2, I assume it is for 3.* in general



Hello,
I have ran into an issue when using the Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Validator\Constraints\UserPassword validator and PHP 7.1 - if the field value is empty (a null), the validator breaks on this line with a warning hash_equals(): Expected user_string to be a string, null given.
Usually validators simply check the value for a null and return if found, but here it just passes it on further and allows it to break. Same goes for Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Validator\Constraints\UniqueEntityValidator and it requires me to overwrite these classes and manually add a check for null. I can make a PR fixing this, assuming everyone is fine with this change.
