RFC: Allow passing -verbose to meta status


A common issue when using nomad is needing to add in the object verb to
a command to include the -verbose flag.
This commit allows users to pass -verbose via the nomad status alias by
adding a placeholder boolean in the metacommand which allows subcommands
to parse the flag.
I'll clean this up if it's something that the rest of the team is
interested in and will find useful.
