Http Firewall ExceptionListener : setTargetPath() should not be called on subrequests


In cases where a subrequest triggers an auth error, the ExceptionListener stores the url of the subrequest as targetPath.
Once the user logs in, he lands on the url for the subrequest instead of the url he should land on.
This happens with fos_user_content_hash as well as with _fragment urls.
