Autocomplete completes URLs typed in a private tab


Description
URLs typed in the URL field when on a private tab, are remembered. I do not expect this behaviour, since I am on a private tab, and would expect autocomplete to not remembers those urls.
This can expose private links to others.
Steps to Reproduce

Open a new private tab
In the URL field at the top, type a URL. For instance, example.com
Open a new normal tab
When in the URL field one starts typing "e", autocomplete completes the URL and proposes (possibly amongst others) example.com

Actual result:
autocomplete completes the URL and proposes 'example.com' even when in a normal tab
Expected result:
autocomplete does not propose 'example.com', not in a normal and not in a private tab: there should be no history of these.
Reproduces how often:
every time
