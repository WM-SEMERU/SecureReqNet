update typescript docs to reference docgen loader


I'm guessing this was an oversight from some recent upgrade.
Issue: documentation told me to install a plugin, but it appears it then wants me to use a loader.
What I did
Checked what the modern approach is (use the loader) and updated the documentation.
How to test

Does this need an update to the documentation?

Yes.
