Add basic UsersUnsubscribe page


Fixes #7840

This patch adds a new UsersUnsubscribe page component. It won't be enabled in -dev because the route is redirected to addons-server at the nginx level. This patch supports #7656. It does NOT perform any action yet.
Being logged in or out does not matter because we'll use the hash/token in the URL. That's why the two screenshots thereafter are the same. The UI is similar to the old one but I did not add two links to edit the notification settings/profile. It's the same page, so I added a sentence that explains what a user can do after having landed to this page. That's what I'd expect when landing to this page.
