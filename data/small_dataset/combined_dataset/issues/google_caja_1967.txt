ES5/3 fails in Chrome 44


Uncaught TypeError: 'caller' and 'arguments' are restricted function properties and cannot be accessed in this context.
DefineOwnProperty___ @ es53-taming-frame.js?debug=1:3246
(anonymous function) @ es53-taming-frame.js?debug=1:3633
(anonymous function) @ es53-taming-frame.js?debug=1:6615

This is DefineOwnProperty___ doing "O[P] = O[P]" to ensure the property exists (this was introduced in the r4850 patch for issue 1457), which fails when the object has a native setter that rejects the operation.
(I have a funny feeling that I've seen this issue before in a different form, but I didn't find any relevant change.)
