 Test that windows and tabs restore when closed, including active tab.

 Ensure that the tabs in the above session are being lazy loaded when the session is restored
 Ensure that hovering over lazy loaded tabs correctly loads the tab without any issues


 Move away your entire ~/Library/Application\ Support/Brave folder (%appdata%\Brave in Windows, ./config/brave in Ubuntu)
