claim button still visible but blank after claiming grant


Description
Once I claimed my UGP grant, I had a few meetings and left Brave opened. When I returned, I noticed that there was still a Claim button visible which was blank. Clicking on the button would launch the CAPTCHA but I couldn't claim anymore BAT as I've already received some from this particular grant. When clicking the blank button and completing the CAPCHA, I get the following:

Steps to Reproduce
N/A - Still trying to find some STR. Ran into this while I was having several 1:1's. Left Brave opened after accepting a grant and noticed that the claim button was still there.
Actual result:

Expected result:
Once a grant has been accepted and received, the Claim button should be removed from the UI.
Reproduces how often:
I've only ran into this once so far and don't have any reliable STR. Still attempting to gather more information.
