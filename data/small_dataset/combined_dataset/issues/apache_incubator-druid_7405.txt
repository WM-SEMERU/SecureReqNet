Add Druid SQL support to JetBrains DataGrip


Description
JetBrains DataGrip is a cross-database IDE which is meant for the current era of teams using multiple databases. It currently supports around 20 different database systems.
JetBrains provides guidelines to database vendors on how to help them onboarding a new DBMS: https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/new_dbms/
It would be nice if we can gather the required information and work with JetBrains on onboarding.
Motivation
With the latest improvements to Druid SQL, including metadata access, it would be a good opportunity to promote Druid and reach a broader audience via an existing database IDE.
Also, the product is just great to use, so I hope using it with Druid.
