'### Summary

When using Chrome, you can add multiple "persons" to your browser.  
Each has it's own "scope".  
For example, when I go in a browser window with person 1 to gitlab.com I am logged in.  
But when I open a browser window with person 2, and I go to gitlab.com, I am not logged in.  
This is expected, because you are a different entity / user (person).  

However, for some reason in GitLab CE 9.3.3 (I don't experienced this bug in older versions) it seems that there is some link between the two sessions.  
It started when I was logged in on both persons in Chrome, but under different GitLab user accounts.  
Person 1 started a MR, and person 2 was merging that requests.  
After the merge completed (while both persons stays on that MR page) it seems that some weird session swapping is happening.  
Person 1 is suddenly logged in as person 2 after refreshing (sometimes it takes a couple of refreshings) and person 2 is logged in as person 1.  
In my case, person 2 is an admin and person 1 is not.  
So it's pretty bad that (even with 2FA enabled on all users) you can log in as admin (or any user, for that matters) without a password or 2FA.

Besides that this bug happens in MR's, I also occur it when loggin in on one person, while not logged in with the other person.  
After loggin in with person 1, person 2 is also logged in as the same user.  

Note: The `_gitlab_session` cookie is different from both. And is doesn't always happen.  
Not exactly figured out when this exactly is the case.

### Steps to reproduce
