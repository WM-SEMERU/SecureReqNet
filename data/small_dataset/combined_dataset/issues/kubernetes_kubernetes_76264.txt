Set sane defaults for the proxy transport


What type of PR is this?
/kind bug
/kind cleanup
What this PR does / why we need it:
This PR sets "sane" defaults for the http.Transport which gets created for the proxy transport (Used when communicating to Nodes, Extension API servers - and potentially more).
We've seen timeouts in the AvailableController when it does the discovery of extension API servers:
E0406 20:48:14.164885       1 available_controller.go:316] v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io failed with: Get https://10.47.244.118:443: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)

10.47.244.118 Is a virtual IP which points to 2 instances of the metrics-server.
The timeouts occure whenever on of the metrics-server instances get killed (Probably the one, the Kube API server has a connection to).
The AvailableController now only receives timeouts for the next 15-20 min, despite another instance of the metrics-server is alive.
When doing a curl https://10.47.244.118:443 from the API server instance, everything works fine, which is why i assume the used http.Transport to be causing issues.
The http.Transport has some defaults which might be undesirable:

pmorie/go-open-service-broker-client#132
golang/go#26013

Regarding testing:
I'm able to reproduce the bug in our environment (Loodse/Kubermatic - Kubernetes in Kubernetes) but didn't had the time to test this in other environments.
Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
NONE
