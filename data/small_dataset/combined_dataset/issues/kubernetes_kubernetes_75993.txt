Adding RemainingItemCount to ListMeta


Adding ListMeta.RemainingItemCount. If the server has more data available for a LIST request, the ListOptions.RemainingItemCount is set to the number of remaining objects.
This doesn't add any additional traffic to etcd. The etcd server already included the count in the GET response.
Without this "count" feature, clients need to list through all pages to get a count.
Alternatives:

etcd v3 API supports --count-only, and the Kubernetes storage layer does support Count(), so alternatively, we can add a COUNT verb to Kubernetes REST API, but that sounds like an overkill. With the API in this PR, clients can get a cheap count by setting listOptions.Limit=1.
