Allow requiring client certificates for HTTP access


Currently mutual TLS is only enforced for Nomad's RPC. Users interacting with Nomad's HTTP endpoint do not need to present a client certificate even when all TLS options are enabled on the agent.
A new tls option should be added to allow requiring clients to present a certificate signed by the same CA when communicating with the HTTPS API.
