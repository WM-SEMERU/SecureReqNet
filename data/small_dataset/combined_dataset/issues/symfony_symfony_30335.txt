In short, when using PhpDocExtractor, it ignores the constructor argument type, although argument types from the constructor are the only types that are valid for the class instantiation.
This PR adds a separate extractor - ConstructorExtractor which is called first (-999) and it attempts to extract the type from constructor only, either from PhpDoc or using reflection.
I added getTypesFromConstructor to PhpDocExtractor and ReflectionExtractor - they implement ConstructorArgumentTypeExtractorInterface interface. ConstructorExtractor aggregates those extractors using compiler pass.
So the flow of control looks like this:
PropertyInfoExtractor::getTypes:
    - ConstructorExtractor::getTypes
        - PhpDocExtractor::getTypesFromConstructor
        - ReflectionExtractor::getTypesFromConstructor
    - PhpDocExtractor::getTypes
    - ReflectionExtractor::getTypes
