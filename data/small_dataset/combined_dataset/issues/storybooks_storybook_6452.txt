Storybook does not work with RN0.59.+


Describe the bug
Unable to load findSymlinksPaths: Cannot find module 'react-native/local-cli/util/findSymlinksPaths'
error: unknown option `--projectRoots'
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Upgrade to latest react-native version
run storybook start -p 7007 | react-native start --projectRoot storybook

Additional context
I think the problem is because the path is wrong, now the cli is from @react-community/cli
