This PR adds a new EventDispatcherInterface in Contracts. This interface contains only one method: dispatch($event, $eventName). That covers almost all use cases of the event dispatcher in components (some use add/removeListeners/Subscribers but they are a minority.)
While doing so, it allows dispatching any objects as events - not only instances of Event.
This allows decoupling e.g. Messenger from the EventDispatcher component.
Next steps could be about planning to remove the base Event class from some concrete event classes and/or moving EventSubscriberInterface to symfony/contracts. It would allow decoupling e.g. Workflow from the component - but that's too far away for now, let's think about it in 5.1.
