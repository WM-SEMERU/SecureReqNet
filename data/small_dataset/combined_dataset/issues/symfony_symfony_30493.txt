debug:autowiring doesn't show classes when run without --all


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.4
Description
When there is an autowirable class, that could be shown via debug:autowiring, an exception should be expected if the '--all' flag is not set and the passed argument doesn't match the alias.
How to reproduce
Create a new project:
  symfony new test
  cd test

Create a simple class Test.php in src. This is autowired.
Executing
  bin/console debug:autowiring Test

it doesn't show the class, nor it returns an exception. This is because, since the service has no alias, there is no text added to the output here: https://github.com/symfony/framework-bundle/blob/master/Command/DebugAutowiringCommand.php#L114
Possible Solutions
Throw an exception in the line above.
Print something that says "There are matching services but without that exact match".
Print the class anyway.
