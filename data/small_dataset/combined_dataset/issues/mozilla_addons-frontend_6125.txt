Logged out users still appear logged in when navigating out of and back into AMO frontend


STR:

Load AMO - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
Log in
Log out
Click on Developer Hub in the header
Go back to AMO

Actual result:
The user still appears to be logged in. Navigation through pages that require a logged in state is possible (see user collections page)
Expected result:
User is logged out
Notes:

I've checked this scenario with a clean profile and the issue can be reproduced as well
the logged out state is set after the page is reloaded
reproduced on all AMO servers with FF61, Win10x64
