Current behavior:
ng-required="!foo" still marks the field required if foo===true but ng-required="{false: 'true'}[foo]" works as expected.
Expected / new behavior:
Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions:
see above, it's pretty simple
AngularJS version: 1.x.y
version 1.7.6 - works fine in 1.7.5
Browser: [all | Chrome XX | Firefox XX | Edge XX | IE XX | Safari XX | Mobile Chrome XX | Android X.X Web Browser | iOS XX Safari | iOS XX UIWebView | iOS XX WKWebView | Opera XX ]
all browsers
Anything else:
I guess I might explain why I am even using it this way.  a bunch of fields are created by an ng-repeat and I don't want the last field requied so I was using ng-required="!$last" which worked in 1.7.5 but is now broken in 1.7.6 and I tried a bunch of stuff and narrowed it down to it just not liking anything with the !
