Firewall does not recognize {_locale}


I know this was fixed in Beta5, but something seems to have changed and it does not seem to be working any longer in RC3.
In Beta5 the following worked for the url /en/login, /en/login_check, and /en/logout:
firewalls:
main:
pattern:      .*
form_login:
provider:       fos_userbundle
login_path:     /{_locale}/login
use_forward:    false
check_path:     /{_locale}/login_check
failure_path:   null
logout:
path:   /{_locale}/logout
target: /
anonymous:    true
However, in RC3, when the login form submits to the url:
http://localhost/Symfony/web/app_dev.php/en/login_check
...the response is:
"You must configure the check path to be handled by the firewall using form_login in your security firewall configuration."
It appears the firewall doesn't recognize that "/{_locale}/login_check" should match "/en/login_check".
But, when I change the check_path to: "/en/login_check", and the login_path to "/en/login",  I can login fine.
The same situation occurs with logout.
On the Symfony2 list, Stof said some changes were made, and now we should be using route names in the firewall instead of paths. The thread is here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/symfony2/_gAf_mdxmJc
So, I replaced the paths with routes, but  that also doesn't seem to work:
app/config/security.yml

security:
providers:
fos_userbundle:
id: fos_user.user_manager
firewalls:
    main:
        pattern:      .*
        form_login:
            provider:       fos_userbundle
            login_path:     fos_user_security_login
            use_forward:    false
            check_path:     fos_user_security_check
            failure_path:   null
        logout:
            path:   fos_user_security_logout
            target: /
        anonymous:    true

access_control:
    # The WDT has to be allowed to anonymous users to avoid requiring the login with the AJAX request
    - { path: ^/_wdt/, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
    - { path: ^/_profiler/, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
    # AsseticBundle paths used when using the controller for assets
    - { path: ^/js/, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
    - { path: ^/css/, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
    # URL of FOSUserBundle which need to be available to anonymous users
    - { path: ^/(en|fr|he|ru)/login, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
    - { path: ^/(en|fr|he|ru)/register, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
    - { path: ^/(en|fr|he|ru)/resetting, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
   # Secured part of the site
    # This config requires being logged for the whole site and having the admin role for the admin part.
    # Change these rules to adapt them to your needs
    - { path: ^/.*/admin/, role: ROLE_ADMIN }
    - { path: ^/.*, role: ROLE_USER }

role_hierarchy:
    ROLE_ADMIN:       ROLE_USER
    ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN:  ROLE_ADMIN

app/config/routing.yml

fos_user_security:
resource: "@FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/security.xml"
prefix: /{_locale}
fos_user_profile:
resource: "@FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/profile.xml"
prefix: /{_locale}/profile
fos_user_register:
resource: "@FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/registration.xml"
prefix: /{_locale}/register
fos_user_resetting:
resource: "@FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/resetting.xml"
prefix: /{_locale}/resetting
fos_user_change_password:
resource: "@FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/change_password.xml"
prefix: /{_locale}/change-password
With the above setup, when I go to the url  /en/login, I get the message:
"The "fos_user_security_logout" route has some missing mandatory parameters ("_locale")."
Stof recommended I open this ticket.
