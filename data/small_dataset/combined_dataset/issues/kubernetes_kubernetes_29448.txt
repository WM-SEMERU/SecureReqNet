Kubelet should attach SHA of image(s) to pod status


Moving this piece from this comment. Generally the idea is to have the kubelet to attach SHA of the image(s) running in a pod in the pod status field. This will be useful for the aforementioned image policy proposal and related image auditing capabilities.
