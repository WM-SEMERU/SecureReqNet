The commit in !79 broke the LDAP user filter because GitLab's LDAP user filters are not compatible with the format expected by omniauth-ldap: omniauth-ldap expects you to include the username into the filter using a format string.

Example GitLab LDAP user filter: `(memberOf=cn=foo,dc=bar)`

Example omniauth-ldap user filter: `(&(uid=%{username})(memberOf=cn=foo,dc=bar))`.

We are working on a fix.
