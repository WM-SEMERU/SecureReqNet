target_path not set after a AccessDeniedException


Hi !
I'm throwing manually a AccessDeniedException in one of my controller action. I'm then correctly redirected to the firewall's login page however, the _security.my_firewall.target_path session variable is not set...
Why that?
By the way, the Symfony2 Google group seems to be not accessible (it says I'm not allowed to see it error #418).
Thanks
Thomas
