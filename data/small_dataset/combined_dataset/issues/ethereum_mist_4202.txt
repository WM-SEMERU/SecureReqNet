Did I lose my account?


OS: Windows 7
Wallet type: Ethereum Wallet
Version: 0.11.1
Hi all,
The situation: I didn't use my wallet for a couple of months. Yesterday I've launched it and it asked for a manual geth update. Being a complete noob, I decided to download the latest version of wallet and just rewrite it over current folder. That didn't help, then I downloaded geth here: https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/ and installed it. After this wallet opened but with no account details.
Now I don't know how to get back to my account, I only know password and its external address.
I've checked AppData\Roaming\Ethereum\keystore for possible data restore, but this folder is empty.
At this point, are there any ways to get my account back or it is gone forever?
Any help or advice much appreciated!
