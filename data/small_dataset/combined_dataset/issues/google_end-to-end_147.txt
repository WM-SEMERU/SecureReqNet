No 'MDC' Feature in Generated keys, but is required by RFC-6637

Is this report about the crypto library or the extension?
library
What is the security bug?
Public keys generated by the library don't have a "Features" signature subpacket showing support for MDC. As a result, encrypting with GPG v2.1 won't encrypt to packet #18s, but will instead encrypt to packet #9s.
It's worth noting that RFC-6637 requires MDCs with ECDH in Section 8.
How would someone exploit it?
Chosen ciphertext attack on 3DES (see previous bug report).
