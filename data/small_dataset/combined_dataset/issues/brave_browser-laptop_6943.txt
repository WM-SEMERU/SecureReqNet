Delete log in credential for LastPass via preferences setting


Describe the issue you encountered:
https://community.brave.com/t/lastpass-security-issue/944

I set my browser to delete all stored data after closing Brave but I noticed this morning that My LastPass was still logged in after hart shutdown of my PC. So after the restart when I launched Brave my LastPass account was active still.



Brave Version (revision SHA):  0.13.0


Extra QA steps:

Log in LastPass with your credential
Enable a proper option like "Clear Extention credentials" on about:preferences#security
Restart
Make sure you were logged out of LastPass
