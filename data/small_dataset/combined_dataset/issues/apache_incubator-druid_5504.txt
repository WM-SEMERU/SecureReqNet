Fix supervisor tombstone auth handling


#5501 resulted in "tombstone" NoopSupervisorSpecs being filtered out of the spec histories.
This PR adjusts NoopSupervisorSpecs so that they record the datasource list of the previous running spec, for authorization purposes.
NoopSupervisorSpecs created before this change will have a null datasource list and will be visible to all users, for backwards compatibility.
