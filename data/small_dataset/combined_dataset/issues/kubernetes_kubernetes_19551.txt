Reclassify [Skipped] issues: Security Context


@swagiaal there is a test that you marked as skipped that needs to be reenabled or otherwise taken care of (see #19505):

"Security Context [Skipped]"

Can we instead classify these as [Feature:SecurityContext]? See #19505 for context.
Happy to answer any questions if anything doesn't make sense.
