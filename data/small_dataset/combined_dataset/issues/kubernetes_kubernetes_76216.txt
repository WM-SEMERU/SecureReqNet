ensuring that logic is checking for differences in listener


What type of PR is this?
/kind bug
What this PR does / why we need it:
Part of the code for the ensureLoadBalancer method for AWS checks to see if a listener has changed. If so, it will delete and recreated it. However, this logic is flawed and will result in the lister being deleted/recreated every time even if it hasn't changed. This PR fixes that logic.
