Screwed Kongregate and Playfab


Installed this new version of Brave and for some reason my Kongregate games are all screwed up. The console shows Playfab Account logged in: False
I went to Chrome, loaded a game, exported the save file, opened Brave, imported the file and it loaded up. Closed Brave, reopened it, and it was as if I did nothing. Console said it couldn't find either the offline or the online (which it can't because Playfab is screwed)
