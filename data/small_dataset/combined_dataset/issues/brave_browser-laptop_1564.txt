Add NoScript feature


This adds a noscript feature which can be turned off globally, for the current site temporarily, or for the current site permanently.
I chose to put the noscript site options in a popup on the right side of the urlbar, which is what chrome does. Ideally this would be merged with the UI for per-site bravery settings when that exists. CC @bradleyrichter for design thoughts.
Fix #231

^ noscript popup appears when clicking on the red ban icon. ideally it would be something similar to the noscript logo, which is what noscript users are used to clicking on.
