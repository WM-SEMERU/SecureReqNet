IntelliSense is not working on a large project on VS2019


Hi.
I've got several Python projects of different sizes and different dependency sets.
All of them were and still are getting handled well with the latest VS2015 and VS2017 PTVS versions.
I had also tested them with VS2019 preview and everything seemed to work fine there too until as long as Preview Update 2.2. Then I took a pause in my experiments with VS2019 until this week when it was finally released. And it seems that something had changed during this time, so now there are major troubles with Python IntelliSense in there.
I've tried the Community Edition today and IntelliSense just wouldn't do anything there. Even though there are no significant warnings or errors, the class/module name colors are not not applied and no auto-completion is working either.
After that I tried Preview Update 2.2 and it everything was fine until I upgraded it to Preview Update 5  when it had stopped working too.
It seems the project size is of the essence in this case. I had managed to work this issue around for a couple smaller Python 2.7 and Python 3.7 projects by removing some unneeded Python modules from the project root folders (even though those modules were never a part of .pyproj), but even in this case IntelliSence works noticeable slower in VS2019 than it was working earlier and than it is in VS2017.
I was less lucky with my biggest project (Python 2.7 + Django + AppEngine + numpy) -- whatever I do, with no errors or warning, IntelliSense just wouldn't do it's magic in VS2019 anymore ðŸ˜¢
Is this a known issue? Maybe there is a way to work this around by increasing VS performance via tweaking it's settings somehow? Turning off some of the most time/memory consuming features or something?
