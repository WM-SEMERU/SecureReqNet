'www.' URL normalization code is not correct


there are a bunch of places in the code that call something like host = host.replace('www.', ''), presumably for the purpose of considering 'www.example.com' and 'example.com' to be equal.
this doesn't work on URLs like wowww.com (which turns into wocom).
