Support U2F Keys


Test plan
See #12507
Original issue description
I use a U2F key (YubiKey Neo) for Two factor authentication in locations such as here on github and with Google accounts (as well as Lastpass extension).
While the key works great in Chrome, it's not currently supported in Brave. This is a significant blocker for me. I'd love to see this functionality implemented. See the error I get when trying log into my github account with Brave (at the point where the security key is requested).
