Compile the Intl data by invoking a single command, and make it work out-of-the-box. (Split from #28831)
$ src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Resources/bin/compile
run in repository root because of



symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Data/Generator/LocaleDataGenerator.php

3.4 is ok, 4.2 is not because of #28833 but new locales are introduced in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/28977/files#diff-f52da32e1ee6b93598814090d0749aa6R1
So as long as 3.4 is supported, but branches above add filters etc. during generation we're risking this discrepancy. I suggest after merge in upper branches to re-run compile (potential for automating, but run if needed :))
