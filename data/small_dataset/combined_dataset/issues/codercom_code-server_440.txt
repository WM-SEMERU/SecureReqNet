127.0.0.1 by default vs 0.0.0.0



code-server version: v1.604-vsc1.32.0
OS Version: macOS 10.14.4 (18E226)

Description
It has been discussed that using 127.0.0.1 might be better than using 0.0.0.0 for the default host for security reasons when running code-server. A user should have to explicitly set 0.0.0.0 as the host if they want to use it with the -h flag
Steps to Reproduce

Start code server INFO  Starting webserver... {"host":"0.0.0.0","port":8443}
