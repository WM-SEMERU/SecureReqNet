Following a suggestion by @ogizanagi in #27262,
Here's a proposal to render the Request Graph, from the performance profiler panel, with SVG instead of canvas.
Some benefits of the SVG format:

The text labels are searchable and can be selected.
It renders well on high DPI monitors.
Colors and text styles can be defined with CSS just like the rest of the page.

In addition, SVG allow us to consider (and easily implement) interactives features such as:

Zoom in and time navigation (thanks to the viewport).
Highlight hovered line (or other DOM related events).

Preview:

Filtered events example:

Progress :

 Render request events in SVG
 Show labels with duration and memory
 Show specific markers at start / end of lines
 Re-render graph when window resize
 Re-render graph when threshold change.
  Generate graph legend with only existing categories (part 1. of #27262 )
 Show sub-request area with hatched pattern
  Allow to hide categories by clicking them on the legend (part 3. of #27262 )
 Handle text overflow on long labels.
 Ensure JS code is compatible with all supported browsers (used classes and arrow functions.
Add left-padding to sub-request graph?
