Request::isSecure returns that url is not secured when server HTTPS variable is "OFF"


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4.15 and maybe other versions
Description
By the documentation:
http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php
'HTTPS' => 'Set to a non-empty value if the script was queried through the HTTPS protocol.'
So if HTTPS is "OFF" or "ON" or "BLABLA" its all good and isSecure should return true, which is not case for "OFF"
How to reproduce
I noticed bug on my production server where server HTTPS variable was "OFF" and SERVER_PORT was "443"
Possible Solution
Check for empty (null) value in isSecure method instead of string "OFF"
