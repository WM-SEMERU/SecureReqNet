[Routing] int type hinting in a route can lead to an invalid one


Symfony version(s) affected: I've reproduced it on 4.2.2 and 4.2.3-dev (can't say for previous version, but it's probably older that this 2 ones)
Description
Type hinting route parameter as an int can lead to a wrong value.
It's seems to be only on specific values (didn't find any patern) and is not happening on more than 1% of my routes, but i can trigger it endlessly for the values that are bugging.
Example:
My route {{baseUrl}}/api/challenges/2555
If if specify in my route that my challengeId is supposed to be an int, i'm ending with that case :

We can see that the provided $challengeId is 13823 but if i explode the route, everything is correct and the third part of the uri is 2555 as expected.
Workaround
Removing the type hinting in the request is enough to avoid this issue,  here with our current example :
