After this line https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/platform-browser/src/security/html_sanitizer.ts#L243 unsafeHtml is mutated and contains parsedHtml and then in fact parsedHtml is compared to safeHtml (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/platform-browser/src/security/html_sanitizer.ts#L261)
