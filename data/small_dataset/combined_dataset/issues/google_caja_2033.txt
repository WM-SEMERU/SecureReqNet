Support override of ALLOWED_URI_SCHEMES with html4.allowedUriSchemes


This indirectly addresses Issue 1558.
That issue is about data: and javascript: not being allowed protocols for URIs.  This change allows the HTML sanitizer to be configured to allow any URI protocol by using a new html4 attribute, allowedUriSchemes.  This custom attribute, if defined, will be used instead of the hardcoded RegEx ALLOWED_URI_SCHEMES.
For instance, to allow both data: and javascript: URIs:
html4.allowedUriSchemes = /^(?:https?|geo|mailto|sms|tel|data|javascript)$/i;
var newHTML = html_sanitize(oldHTML);
