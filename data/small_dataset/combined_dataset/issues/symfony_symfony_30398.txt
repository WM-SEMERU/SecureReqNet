Description
Symfony Form doesn't like special characters when expanded = true in a EntityType field
How to reproduce
public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder
            ->add('field', EntityType::class, [
                'class' => 'App:Category',
                'choice_name' => 'name',
                'placeholder' => 'Choose a Category',
                'multiple' => false,
                'expanded' => true,
            ])
            ->getForm();

.......

Possible Solution
change expanded to false
it would work with the same data
Additional context
I have a category name that contains " ! "
