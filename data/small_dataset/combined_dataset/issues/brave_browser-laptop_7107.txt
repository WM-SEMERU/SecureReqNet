Description

 Submitted a ticket for my issue if one did not already exist.
 Used Github auto-closing keywords in the commit message.
 Added/updated tests for this change (for new code or code which already has tests).
 Ran git rebase -i to squash commits (if needed).

Rework alert/confirm to be tab-modal (instead of application-modal)
Message box:

shows an on/off switch for "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs". Fixes #3794
does not include Brave logo; shows origin; does not need to show "switch to tab" because it's already bound to tab. Fixes #2755
is shown BELOW tabs now. Fixes #6901

Other changes include:

Removed "An embedded page at " from source message (shown on every message)
Rename showMessageBox/hideMessageBox/clearMessageBoxes actions to showNotification/hideNotification/clearNotification
Converted most styles to Aphrodite

Special note
Electron recently received a PR to implement an optional checkbox in electron.dialog.showMessageBox... but this is a better choice for us because it's tab-modal (you can switch tabs while the alert is up, etc).
