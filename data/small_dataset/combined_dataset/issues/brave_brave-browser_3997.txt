issues logging into GitHub


Description
Not able to login Github.com using Brave browser.  Works fine in Chrome.  Seems similar to issue #2489 except it's for Github.  After putting in login info and hitting submit, it simply goes back to login page with no errors.
Steps to Reproduce

Go to Github.com
If you're logged in, log out.
Log in.  It'll fail silently and take you back to login page.

Actual result:
Fails silently and takes you back to the login page.
Expected result:
Shows Github dashboard.
Reproduces how often:

Additional Information
Keep in mind; one thing that may be applicable here is that I was originally logged in already via Chrome prior to importing everything to Brave, so when I attempt to access Github, it sees me as already logged in so I'm able to access everything.  But once I log out and attempt to log back in, that's when it breaks.
