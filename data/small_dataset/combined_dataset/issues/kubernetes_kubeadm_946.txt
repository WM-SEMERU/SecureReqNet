kubeadm CA certs have identical Subject DNs


FEATURE REQUEST
Versions
kubeadm version (use kubeadm version):
kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"11+", GitVersion:"v1.11.0-beta.2", GitCommit:"be2cfcf9e44b5162a294e977329d6c8194748c4e", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2018-06-07T16:19:15Z", GoVersion:"go1.10.2", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
What happened?
The ETCD CA certificate and the api CA certificate both have the same subject DN, but are signed with separate keys.
What you expected to happen?
The Subject DN of the CA certificate should likely be different - with different organisations or organisational_units to describe the particular subset of features the CA is securing (etcd, apiserver, etc).
This guarantees they are always seen as separate CAs.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
$ openssl x509 -subject -nameopt RFC2253 -noout -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
$ openssl x509 -subject -nameopt RFC2253 -noout -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
The DN shown should probably be different
Anything else we need to know?
This is probably a technical violation of RFC 5280 "The DN MUST be unique for each subject
entity certified by the one CA as defined by the issuer field." since the Issuer field of both the certs will be identical as it is self signed. AIUI they are the same CA, just signed with different keys - and we want them to be genuinely different.
I've put this as a feature request, since it depends how you read the spec. Ultimately as they have different keys they can't verify each others certificates (However if you use the same key on an issuer to replicate the certificate exactly they can - hence how I came across it!)
