As follow up for PR #11690 in 2.6, I have removed the SecurityContext, SecurityContextInterface and security.context service. I have split the parts in separate commits to make it easier to review but I can squash them if desired.
I will submit the changes to the documentation when a branch is available to do so. Docs are already updated.
