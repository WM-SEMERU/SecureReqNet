[Security] Huge Overhaul of all security


Hi guys!
I would warmly appreciate review, though, I realize that this is another huge PR. Apologies - but the security section really needed it.
Here are some important notes:


I've made the changes to 4.1, following in a newer policy we've been adopting to only apply changes (with the exception of strict bug fixes) to the current-released branch or higher.


This uses some new features from the upcoming release of MakerBundle. Specifically make:user and the enhanced make:auth that is capable of generating the entire login form setup. These have simplified & shortened parts of the docs.


I've made Guard the preferred authentication mechanism. We show it first... and then mention the other, built-in providers, like form_login, etc.


The simple_preauth and simple_form are not currently documented at all after this change. I believe we should discuss deprecating them.


Cheers!
