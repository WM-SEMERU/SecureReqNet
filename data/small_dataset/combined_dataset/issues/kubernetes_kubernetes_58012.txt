Automated Debian Base Images


Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?:
/kind feature
What happened:
Currently, the Debian base images used to create the hyperkube and other images use a Base Debian docker image that is generated and pushed to gcr.io. It would be awesome to automate the debian base images to automatically be built so they contain patched binaries with security updates.
By enabling this functionality, builds would always use a modern base image with patched binaries.
What you expected to happen:
