Double-check OE_IsOutsideEnclave()


Please double-check OE_IsOutsideEnclave() for correctness. The logic is a bit inside-out, though it appears it incorrectly returns true for a range starting before and ending beyond the enclave.
Consider an overflow-test on p/n, and then an (end <= base) ||  (start >= base+size) test.
