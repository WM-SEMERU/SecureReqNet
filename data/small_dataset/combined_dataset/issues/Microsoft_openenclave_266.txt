Open Enclave users trust that SGX quote parsing is fuzz tested and secure


oe_verify_report handling for remote attestation reports (SGX quotes) introduces a non-trivial amount of parsing code into the OE runtime. This includes:

Logic to interpret Intel's binary SGX quote format and validate signatures over it
Wrapper for mbedtls/openSSL ASN methods to parse custom Intel SGX PCK certificate extensions
Minimal JSON parser for Intel's TCBInfo and QEIdentity blobs

Per security best-practices, we should run the quote handling code under fuzz testing to increase our confidence that the parsing logic is robust and secure.
