'The GitLab LDAP user filter is supposed to be triggered in two situations:

- when the last LDAP check is more than 1 hour old;
- when the LDAP user signs in.

It seems that when we backported the filter from GitLab EE to CE, the code that checks the filter during sign-in (in the OmniauthCallbacksController) was lost.

We need to add the check to the OmniauthCallbacksController.
