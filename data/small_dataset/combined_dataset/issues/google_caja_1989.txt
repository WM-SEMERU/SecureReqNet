html-sanitizer mixing property names in arrays causing headaches for Closure Compiler


Kaitlyn E would like some errors from Closure Compiler to go away:
.../html-sanitizer-bundle.js:2078: ERROR - restricted index type
found   : string
required: number
          attribs = decision['attribs'];
                             ^
html-sanitizer-bundle.js:2085: ERROR - restricted index type
found   : string
required: number
          tagNameRep = decision['tagName'];
                                ^
