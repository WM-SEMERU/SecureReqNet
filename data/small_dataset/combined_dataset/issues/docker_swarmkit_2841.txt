[18.03 backport] Fix leaking task resources when nodes are deleted


backport of #2806 for the bump_v18.03 branch
When a node is deleted, its tasks are asked to restart, which involves
putting them into a desired state of Shutdown. However, the Allocator
will not deallocate a task which is not in an actual state of a terminal
state. Once a node is deleted, the only opportunity for its tasks to
recieve updates and be moved to a terminal state is when the function
moving those tasks to TaskStateOrphaned is called, 24 hours after the
node enters the Down state. However, if a leadership change occurs, then
that function will never be called, and the tasks will never be moved to
a terminal state, leaking resources.
With this change, upon node deletion, all of its tasks will be moved to
TaskStateOrphaned, allowing those tasks' resources to be cleaned up.
