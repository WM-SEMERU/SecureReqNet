Feature: Allow for specifying TLS host name

Issue
For now nomad hardcores tls hostname to server.xxx.nomad, but in my case it would be useful to set it to something custom, so I can use tls certificate issued by 3rd party on real domain (like Let's encrypt).
Ideally I'd be able to configure nomad like so:
tls {
  http = true
  rpc  = true

  ca_file   = "ca.pem"
  cert_file = "nomad.pem"
  key_file  = "nomad-key.pem"

  verify_server_hostname = true
  server_hostname = "example.com"
}

or the server hostname would be fetched from certificate itself
Use case: Allow for easy access to nomad master's  HTTP API available under public domain without certificate issues when accessing via browser/curl, and at the same have verify_server_hostname = true for nomad agents. I'm fine with generating certificates per-server as let's encrypt makes it really easy.
