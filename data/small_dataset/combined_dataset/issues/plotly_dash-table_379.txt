Table triggers render on mouse move


Since the tooltip feature addition, the table is re-rendering on each mouse move. While it's mostly cached an unexpensive vs. an actual full re-render, this still takes ~15ms and happens extremely often.

there's no need to re-render the table when moving inside a cell, a normal debounce for activating the tooltip will do
there's no need to do this if the table doesn't have tooltips (or better yet, if the cells involved do not have tooltips)
