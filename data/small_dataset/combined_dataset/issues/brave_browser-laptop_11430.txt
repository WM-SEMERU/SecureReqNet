Widevine resource ID should be obtained properly


Test plan
See #13575
Original issue details
Currently we use appConfig.widevine.resourceId which is undefined so the improper setting is set.
We should do it like getFlashResourceId.
It was originally set to only the mac path which was wrong.
And then went to undefined here:
f682695
I did a simple test and simply using the old value before that commit doesn't work properly.
