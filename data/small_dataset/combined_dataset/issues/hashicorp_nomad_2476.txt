[exec driver] nomad fs exposes all files within allocation


Nomad version
0.5.4
Operating system and Environment details
Centos 7
Issue
In order to use Nomad with exec driver we have to run it as root. Nomad creates allocation directory by linking dirs and files from host operating system into the chrooted environment. When exploring the filesystem with fs (cli or HTTP api), we can see contents of all files regardless of their access mode.
Expected behavior: Nomad assumes user specified in task description when file is requested so that files that are unavailable for user that is used for task cannot be exposed.
