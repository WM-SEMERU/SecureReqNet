raft: New node can't join cluster anymore using a Follower endpoint


I'm not sure if this is meant to be this way but a new Manager can't join using a Follower endpoint anymore. The unintended consequence is that if the leader (taking care of the CA) dies, we can't join any more nodes to compensate for the failure even though a new Leader was elected in the cluster.
