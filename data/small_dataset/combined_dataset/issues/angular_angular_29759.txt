Reactive form child ControlValueAccessor control's pristine is broken when parent group is disabled and reenabled


üêû bug report
Affected Package
@angular/forms
Description
The issue I am observing is that the pristine property of a custom formControl component (containing a collection of formControls in a child formGroup) using CVA does not update under a specific scenario.
The scenario being, if the parent formGroup that the custom control resides in, is disabled on ngOnInit and then later enabled with user interaction.
The workaround I have used is to execute markAsPristine() when the parent formGroup is reset and when enabling based on the pristine value of the child formGroup.
üî¨ Minimal Reproduction

Create a parent class with a formGroup in a reactive form.
Attach a custom formControl using a CVA component to the formGroup.
In the parent class containing, disable the formGroup using formGroup.disable()
Add a button to enable the formGroup.
When the user clicks the button to enable the group, the child CVA component will show that that it is NOT pristine even though it has not been modified or touched.

A working example to demonstrate the issue:

I have reactive form called "billing-info" with a parent formGroup called "netedForm".
I have a custom form control using CVA called "basic-info" that resided inside the "nestedForm" group.
Clicking on enable still shows the "basic-info" as NOT pristine.
