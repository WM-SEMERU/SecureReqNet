Currently we have a Argon2iPasswordEncoder that may hash passwords using argon2id instead of argon2i (platform-dependent) which is not good.
This deprecates producing/validating argon2id hashed passwords using the Argon2iPasswordEncoder, and adds a Argon2idPasswordEncoder able to produce/validate argon2id hashed passwords only.
