Inheritable permissions and three-state permission mask


i want to differentiate permisssions for only one domain object
so there are basically two states:

allow all except one
deny all except one

unfortunately symfony doesn't see difference between not setting permission and setting false
there should be easier way to allowing/denying one object without setting object-scope permissions for all of them, it's a bit overkill, right?
