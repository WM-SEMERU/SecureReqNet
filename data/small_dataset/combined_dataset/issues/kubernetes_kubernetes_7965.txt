Secure kubelet port 10250


The kubelet exposes an unauthenticated endpoint on port 10250. The issues with this:

there are the debug handlers /exec/ and /run/ that run code in any container on the host
these debug handlers are enabled by default
the code run in the container runs with full root capabilities (compared to docker's root with a capability bounding set)
