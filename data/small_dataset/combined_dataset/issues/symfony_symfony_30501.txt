While working on symfony/symfony-docs#11085, I felt bad about the long notations required for simple redirects and templates rendering template actions, but I love and use those features since always. Then I gave it a try yesterday night and now I realised I missed #24640 and that #25145 has been closed x).
So here we go, here's my WIP. WDYT of this implementation? ping @javiereguiluz?
I'm going to open the PR in the docs so we can discuss the DX changes there too, and keep focus on the code here.
Cheers!
