Split internal client escalation from Authenticator interface


While developing an extension for basic HTTP authentication, I encountered the following problem:
The Authenticator implementation needed to communicate with the coordinator during initialization, grabbing data from an HTTP endpoint, using a DruidLeaderClient. This led to circular dependency issues as the DruidLeaderClient needs an escalated HTTP client created by an Authenticator to successfully authenticate with the coordinator.
This PR splits the "send requests with privileged internal system user credentials" functionality out of the Authenticator interface into a new Escalator interface, to help avoid circular dependency issues when Authenticator extension implementations need to communicate with Druid cluster nodes.
