Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-8409: ASP.NET Core Denial Of Service Vulnerability
Executive summary
Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core 2.1. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.
Microsoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted web requests to the ASP.NET Core application.
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how ASP.NET Core handles parsing web requests.
The underlying problem exists in the System.IO.Pipelines package. If you have other software which uses this package please follow the instructions in the .NET Core bulletin.

Advisory FAQ
How do I know if I am affected?
Applications which use Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.All
ASP.NET Core 2.1 is distributed as part of the .NET Core runtime. To check the current installed runtimes open a command prompt and run the dotnet --info command. If you have a 2.1 or greater runtime installed you will see output like the following;
.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):
 Version:   2.1.401
 Commit:    91b1c13032

Runtime Environment:
 OS Name:     Windows
 OS Version:  10.0.17134
 OS Platform: Windows
 RID:         win10-x64
 Base Path:   C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\2.1.401\

Host (useful for support):
  Version: 2.1.3
  Commit:  124038c13e

.NET Core SDKs installed:
  2.1.4 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
  2.1.401 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]

.NET Core runtimes installed:
  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.3 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]
  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.3 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]
  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.3 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App]

To install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:
  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download

If the highest .NET Core SDK version is less that 2.1.402 or the highest Microsoft.AspNetCore.App runtime version is less that 2.1.4 you are vulnerable to this issue. You may not see any SDK versions if you have only installed the runtime.
To update ASP.NET Core 2.1 you should download and install the .NET Core SDK 2.1.402 on your development machines and build servers, and the .NET Core Runtime 2.1.4 on your deployment servers. Your application will roll forward to these versions on an application restart.
Applications not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or Microsoft.AspNetCore.All
System.IO.Pipelines is distributed both in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and separately as a NuGet package. If you are not using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App or .All, you may still be affected if you are referencing the System.IO.Pipelines package.
Direct dependencies
Direct dependencies are discoverable by examining your csproj file. They can be fixed by editing the project file or using NuGet to update the dependency.
Transitive dependencies
Transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package Contoso.Utility which, in turn, depends on Contoso.Internals and you add the Contoso.Utility package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on Contoso.Utility and, because Contoso.Utility depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the Contoso.Internals package.
Transitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:

In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.
By examining the project.assets.json file contained in the obj directory of your project for csproj based projects

The project.assets.json files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.
There are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, or you can review the project.assets.json file).
Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer
To use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the vulnerable package and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.
For example, searching for Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:

The search results appear as a tree. In the previous results, you can see that a reference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core version 1.1.2 is discovered.
Under the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions.
In screenshot, the application takes a direct dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions.
The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package takes a dependency on a version of Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer, that in turn takes a dependency on a version of Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core.
 Manually reviewing project.assets.json
Open the project.assets.json file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.
Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.
Search the project.assets.json file for the vulnerable package, using the format packagename/ for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:

Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the /.
Compare to the vulnerable versions table.

For example, a search result that shows System.IO.Pipelines/4.5.0 is a reference to version 4.5.0 of System.IO.Pipelines.
If your project.assets.json file includes references to the vulnerable package, then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.
If you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either

None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or
You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.

How do I fix the issue?
Fixing direct dependencies
Open projectname.csproj in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose Edit projectname.csproj from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for PackageReference elements. The following shows an example project file:
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="System.IO.Pipelines" Version="4.5.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
The preceding example has a reference to the vulnerable package, as seen by the single PackageReference element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute.
The package version number is in the Version attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on System.IO.Pipelines version 4.5.0
To update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table previously.
In this example, update System.IO.Pipelines to the appropriate fixed package number for your major version. Save the csproj file. The example csproj now looks as follows:
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="System.IO.Pipelines" Version="4.5.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
If you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated csproj file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.
You can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.
If you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the updated dependencies.
Now recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.
Fixing transitive dependencies
If your transitive dependency review found references to the vulnerable package, you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your csproj file to override the transitive dependency.
Open projectname.csproj in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose Edit projectname.csproj from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.
Look for PackageReference nodes, for example:
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
You must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the vulnerable package by adding it to the csproj file.
You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.
For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable System.ServiceModel.Http version, you'd add a reference to the fixed package number.
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="System.IO.Pipelines" Version="4.5.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
After you've added the direct dependency reference, save your csproj file.
If you're using Visual Studio, save your updated csproj file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.
You can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager.
If you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies.
Rebuilding your application
Finally you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.
