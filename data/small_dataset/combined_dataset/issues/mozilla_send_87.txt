Remove bit.ly integration


There was some concern about sending users to a 3rd party for executable/data files (vs the normal webpages we usually use mzl.la for).
We could CNAME f.mzl.la to our s3 bucket and use URLs from there.  Whether or not we shorten the URL, the fragments are still long, so it probably doesn't matter much.
