I use v7.1.0 and import default demo projects in local box.
I try to get this page `http://localhost:3000/admin/projects/twitter%2Fflight` and got 404 error.
The log shows as

```
Started GET "/admin/projects/twitter%2Fflight" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-07-22 17:27:33 +0800
Processing by NamespacesController#show as HTML
  Parameters: {"id"=>"admin/projects/twitter/flight"}
  User Load (2.8ms)  SELECT  `users`.* FROM `users`  WHERE `users`.`id` = 1  ORDER BY `users`.`id` ASC LIMIT 1
  Namespace Load (1.9ms)  SELECT  `namespaces`.* FROM `namespaces`  WHERE `namespaces`.`path` = 'admin/projects/twitter/flight' LIMIT 1
  Rendered public/404.html (0.2ms)
Completed 404 Not Found in 17ms (Views: 4.6ms | ActiveRecord: 4.7ms)
```

I try to fix route definition, just add a `%` in id constraints, like

```
namespace :admin do
  resources :projects, constraints: { id: /[a-zA-Z.\/0-9_\-%]+/ }, only: [:index, :show] do
    member do
      put :transfer
    end
  end
end
```

This fix resolves the 404 error. But I can't say it is a good way.
Any idea?
