Templates - default port of 50051 may fail with socket error if docker or hyper-v is installed


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The choice of 50051 as the default port may be problematic if Docker or Hyper-v is installed. This manifests as
an attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions
Not sure yet if all templates use the same port, I was using the gRpc template.
Describe the solution you'd like
Either move the port outside if the range of ports reserved by docker and hyper-v or include a comment in the code to describe what may happen.
Additional context
These reserved ports do not show up under netstat, so it took a while to figure out what was going on.
FWIW, I did find a reference to this in the notes for kb4074588
