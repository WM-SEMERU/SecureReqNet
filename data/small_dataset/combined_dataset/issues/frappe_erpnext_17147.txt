Error for item absent variants - Value cannot be changed for Variant Based On


I have error "Value cannot be changed for Variant Based On" when editing item and we havenâ€™t variants at all in item list.
I noticed

the same item with an error today I changed 9 days ago (at 28.03.2019) and all was OK, we did not make any changes during this time for this item (and other old items).
we have items added 4 days ago (at 01.04.2019), I can change them all without error. But all older items have error - Value cannot be changed for Variant Based On.



The same problem at User Forum without solution:
