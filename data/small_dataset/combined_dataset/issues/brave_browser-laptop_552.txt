Add CSP to app/*.html

[For the about-* pages]

We should set a strict CSP on pages with nodeintegration to limit the runtime attack surface. At minimum:
default-src 'self' (don't load any resources from other origins)
form-action 'none'
frame-ancestors 'none' (prevent clickjacking)
plugin-types 'none'
referrer 'no-referrer'
sandbox 'allow-scripts'
app/index.html and app/index-dev.html should also have this CSP; i assume it's possible to add custom
HTTP headers in webpack? if not, most of these (but not all) can be specified in a  element.
