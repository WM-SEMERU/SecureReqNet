Samples do not work due to IIS InProcess


Since InProcess became the default mode many of the samples in this repo have stopped working with 500.0 - ANCM In-Process Handler Load Failure. Adding <AspNetCoreHostingModel>OutOfProcess</AspNetCoreHostingModel> to their csproj makes them work again.
Some of these projects don't have a reference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS nor call UseIIS(), but adding those is not enough.
The NativeIISSample is the only one I've seen that still works and that's because it heavily customized the launch settings.
Ideally any customizations needed to make InProcess work in this repo would be consolidated to some shared source dependency we could reference from all of the samples.
