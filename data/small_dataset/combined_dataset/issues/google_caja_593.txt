Refactor rewriting rules to centralize rejection of illegal names -- those ending in double "_".


Original issue 593 created by erights on 2008-06-13T03:15:46.000Z:
Refactor rewriting rules to reject illegal names in the earlier scope
visitor, or somewhere small, rather than rejecting them in a bunch of
separate rules scattered thru DefaultCajaRewriter.java.
