client: don't disable TLSv1, TLSv1.1 by default that breaks VMware env


This fixes the issue that TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 are still used by CloudStack
management server to communicate with VMware vCenter server. With the
current defaults, the setup/deployment on VMware fails. Users/admins
can however setup the security file according to their env needs to
disable TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 for server sockets (8250/agent service for
example).
