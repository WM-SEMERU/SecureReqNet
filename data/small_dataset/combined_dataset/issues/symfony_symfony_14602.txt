This PR is a follow-up to #5189, which was in a stand-still for a few years now. It tries to fix the remaining issues which were mentioned in the discussion.
There are still a few issues with the PR, as it is. For example, it introduces two new firewall factories, whereas the base factories (form_login and http_basic) could simply introduce new configuration options.
Also, for a user to use an LDAP server as an authentication provider, he first needs to define a service which should be an instance of Symfony\Component\Security\Ldap\Ldap.
For example:
services:
    my_ldap:
        class: Symfony\Component\Security\Ldap\Ldap
        arguments: [ "ldap.mydomain.tld" ]
Then, in security.yml, this service can be used in both the user provider and the firewalls:
security:
    encoders:
        Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User: plaintext

    role_hierarchy:
        ROLE_ADMIN:       ROLE_USER
        ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH]

    providers:
        ldap_users:
            ldap:
                service: my_ldap
                base_dn: dc=MyDomain,dc=tld
                search_dn: CN=My User,OU=Users,DC=MyDomain,DC=tld
                search_password: p455w0rd
                filter: (sAMAccountName={username})
                default_roles: ROLE_USER

    firewalls:
        dev:
            pattern:  ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
            security: false
        demo_login:
            pattern:  ^/login$
            security: false
        api:
            provider: ldap_users
            stateless: true
            pattern:    ^/api
            http_basic_ldap:
                service: my_ldap
                dn_string: "{username}@MYDOMAIN"
        demo_secured_area:
            provider: ldap_users
            pattern:    ^/
            logout:
                path:   logout
                target: login
            form_login_ldap:
                service: my_ldap
                dn_string: CN={username},OU=Users,DC=MyDomain,DC=tld
                check_path: login_check
                login_path: login
