delete gives access to globals


Original issue 162 created by felix8a on 2008-04-01T20:39:32.000Z:
<script>
delete alert(1)[alert(2)];
</script>
cajoles to this:
{
.loadModule(function (___OUTERS) {
{
.deletePub(alert(1), alert(2));
}
___OUTERS.emitHtml___('\n');
});
}
I think the deleteProp and deletePub rules need calls to expand()
