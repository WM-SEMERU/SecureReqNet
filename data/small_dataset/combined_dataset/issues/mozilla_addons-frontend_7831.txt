Add tooltips to the Extension Workshop and DevHub header links


To better explain what Extension Workshop and Developer Hub are, and how they are different, @MeridelW suggested we add tooltip text to both links. This is only for the header links in the frontend.

Extension Workshop: "Learn how to create extensions and themes"
Developer Hub: "Submit and manage extensions and themes"
