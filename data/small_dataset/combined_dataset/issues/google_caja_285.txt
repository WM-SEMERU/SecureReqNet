delete rules forgot to check for global this


Original issue 285 created by erights on 2008-05-17T23:25:57.000Z:
<script>
delete this['x_'];
</script>
cajoles to
<script type="text/javascript">{
_.loadModule(function (, IMPORTS__) {
{
caja.result(_.deleteProp(IMPORTS, 'x'));
}
});
}</script>
which inappropriately uses deleteProp rather than deletePub. This is a
security hole.
