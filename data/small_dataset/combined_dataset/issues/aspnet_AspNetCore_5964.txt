Role-based authorization [Authorize (Roles = "Admin")] does not work when upgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.2


[Authorize (Roles = "Admin")] does not work when upgrading to ASP.net core 2.2
this is controller:

this is database: [AspNetUsers]

this is database: [AspNetRoles]

this is database: [AspNetUserRoles]

This is the result of the run after I login use chris@neo.org

This works on asp.net core 2.1, but it doesn't work when I upgraded to asp.net core 2.2
