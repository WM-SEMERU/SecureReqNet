Hello,

renaming a repo over the settings page (dangerous settings) lead into a 500 error.
It would be good to redirect the user after renaming.

Following can be found in the log:
```
Started PATCH "/thework/thework-console" for xxx at 2014-08-11 14:07:08 +0200
Processing by ProjectsController#update as HTML
  Parameters: {"utf8"=>"âœ“", "authenticity_token"=>"4OU+TBX5w3ZxomRrnNEJw3HrbMADuJf2ecON7Oi8Pt0=", "project"=>{"path"=>"console"}, "id"=>"thework/thework-console"}
Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 454ms

Exception (repository cannot be renamed):
  app/models/project.rb:522:in `rename_repo'
  app/services/projects/update_service.rb:17:in `execute'
  app/controllers/projects_controller.rb:32:in `update'
```

It seems that the repository isn't renamed on the file system.
