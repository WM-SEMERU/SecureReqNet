yes
Describe the issue you encountered:
@willy-b aptly demonstrated in #4798 how it can be handy to use something like:
data:text/html,<script>alert("no crash")</script> as a demonstration
But while most/all browsers allow that, NoScript forbids it.
Expected behavior:
for a security oriented browser, don't allow that.

Brave Version:
0.12.4
Steps to reproduce:

paste into URL bar:
data:text/html,<script>alert("no crash")</script>


Screenshot if needed:

Any related issues:
E.g., a very long stand-alone phishing page can be contained in the URL bar and get rendered in the browser. You don't have to ever visit an actual malicious website. Also, using a URL shortening service can make it all seem innocent as it gets passed around in email.,
