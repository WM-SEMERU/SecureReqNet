[Form] TransformationFailedException with JSON submitted data


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4.24 / 4.2.5
Description
TransformationFailedException thrown when JSON is submitted through HiddenType field. I have one form that is passing a JSON which is a canvas map of a captured signature.
This commit creates the breaking change for us:
symfony/form@4f7d286#diff-9c65c1fe9e9fce8398f48544b0bbf2a5
Specifically this block of code:
} elseif (\is_array($submittedData) && !$this->config->getCompound() && !$this->config->hasOption('multiple')) {
    $submittedData = null;
    $this->transformationFailure = new TransformationFailedException('Submitted data was expected to be text or number, array given.');
}
This runs before a transformer can clean the data and a mapper does not seem to be a good fit for this.
How to reproduce
Submit JSON through a HiddenType form field
Possible Solution
Check for an additional form option scalar = false or something along those lines.
Example JSON:
[  
   {  
      "lx":132,
      "ly":67,
      "mx":132,
      "my":66
   },
   {  
      "lx":118,
      "ly":27,
      "mx":118,
      "my":26
   },
   {  
      "lx":144,
      "ly":19,
      "mx":144,
      "my":18
   }
]
This can get quite large depending on the size of the complexity of the signature. Transformers and mappers seem to run after this exception is thrown.
Thoughts?
