[Security] Moved Simple{Form,Pre}AuthenticatorInterfaces to Security\Http


Description
The SimpleFormAuthenticatorInterface and SimplePreAuthenticatorInterface rely on Request, which means it's a Http land class. This means they don't belong in core.
Having a form login that doesn't depend on the request is an option as well (e.g. a console application might use the question helper to implement a "form" login). However, then there is a need for a new abstraction of the request. I don't think it's worth it.
Furthermore, the only classes typehinting/relying on this interfaces can be found in Security\Http.
Implementation
The new interfaces extend the old ones for better backwards compability. Symfony doesn't trigger deprecation errors for interfaces, see 6f57b7b
