This is a user reported issue via the security mailing list.

When a user has the profile setting "public email -> do not show in profile" enabled their email address is still made public via the atom feed for their account when they have commented on a public project. Running:

```
curl https://instance/user.atom
```

Will expose their primary email address.

How to duplicate:

*) Create an account with the default "Do not show on profile" setting for the email address.
*) Comment on a public project.
*) Log out and view your atom feed: https://host/user.atom
