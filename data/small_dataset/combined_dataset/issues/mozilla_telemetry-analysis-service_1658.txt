Memory exhaustion in django.utils.numberformat.format()
If django.utils.numberformat.format() -- used by contrib.admin as well as the the floatformat, filesizeformat, and intcomma templates filters -- received a Decimal with a large number of digits or a large exponent, it could lead to significant memory usage due to a call to '{:f}'.format().
Affected versions: >= 1.11.0, < 1.11.19; >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.11; >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.6
