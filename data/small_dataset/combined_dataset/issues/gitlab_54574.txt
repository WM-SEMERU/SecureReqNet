# Issue

I noticed that after clicking on the trash icon to delete a repository project mirror, the database entry isn't actually deleted. It looks like the update request just sets the `enabled` flag to `false`:

```json
project: {remote_mirrors_attributes: {id: 3, enabled: 0}}
```

This is a security issue because the credentials are present in the `remote_mirrors_attributes`.
