The discussion is in previous PR #30056
In short, when using PhpDocExtractor, it ignores the constructor argument type, although argument types from the constructor are the only types that are valid for the class instantiation.
This PR adds a separate extractor - ConstructorExtractor which is called first (-999) and it attempts to extract the type from constructor only, either from PhpDoc or using reflection.
I added getTypesFromConstructor to PhpDocExtractor and ReflectionExtractor - they implement ConstructorArgumentTypeExtractorInterface interface. ConstructorExtractor aggregates those extractors using compiler pass.
So the flow of control looks like this:
PropertyInfoExtractor::getTypes:
    - ConstructorExtractor::getTypes
        - PhpDocExtractor::getTypesFromConstructor
        - ReflectionExtractor::getTypesFromConstructor
    - PhpDocExtractor::getTypes
    - ReflectionExtractor::getTypes
