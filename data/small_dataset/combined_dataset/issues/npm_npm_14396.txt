Abort on unsupported or unknown flags.


I'm opening this issue because:

What's the feature?
Abort execution when npm client is launched with unsupported or unknown flags.
What problem is the feature intended to solve?
Atm, running npm with an unsupported flag does not abort or produce any warnings on unsupported flags.
E.g. running npm --igore-scripts install coffeescript does not give any warnings, does not bail out, but tries to execute node super-evil-script-omg-for-reals.js, which is clearly not something that the user wanted.
Morever, the user probably wanted to launch npm with --ignore-scripts option for security reasons, but that didn't work â€” that causes a security problem for the user. The user surely don't want post/pre-install scripts to be run when they make a mistype in the --ignore-scripts option, and that is exactly what happens now.
This is not a vulnerability, though, so a public report is ok (I notified the npm, Inc team of this earlier, though).
Is the absence of this feature blocking you or your team? If so, how?
No.
Is this feature similar to an existing feature in another tool?
Yes. Many other tools bail out on unsupported options:
$ node --foo
node: bad option: --foo
Is this a feature you're prepared to implement, with support from the npm CLI team?
Most likely, no.
