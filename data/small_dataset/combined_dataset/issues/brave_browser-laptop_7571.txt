show grey insecure icon for passive mixed content


fix #2168
Auditors: @darkdh
Test Plan:

automated tests related to lockIcon should pass
go to mixed.badssl.com; the icon should be a grey unlocked icon
clicking on the icon should tell you that the page is partially insecure


 Submitted a ticket for my issue if one did not already exist.
 Used Github auto-closing keywords in the commit message.
 Added/updated tests for this change (for new code or code which already has tests).
 Ran git rebase -i to squash commits (if needed).
