Two Factor Authentication


Hi ,
I would like to suggest the addition of an optional Two Factor Authentication feature to ERPNext. Considering the sensitive nature of data in an ERP, I think having this feature will go a long way to assure existing and potential users about the security of their data
Thanks
Kind regards,
