add off-by-default application firewall feature


fix #12671
mitigate #12616
test plan:

download an image and name it to rabbits.jpg
in the rabbits.jpg directory, start a localhost server: 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000'
go to https://jsfiddle.net/c6y5qx5m/. you should see either 2 or
3 copies of rabbits.jpg loaded.
go to about:preferences#security and enable 'Application Firewall'
go to https://jsfiddle.net/c6y5qx5m/ in a new private or session tab
(to avoid loading cached files). now none of the rabbits.jpg images
should load.
