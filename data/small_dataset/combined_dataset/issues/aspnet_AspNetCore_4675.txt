Add metadata which says whether or not the type of authentication was persistent


For Antiforgery by default in MVC - we need a way to know that the type of authentication used was a persistent auth.
This should be implemented such that the non-persistent auth schemes (bearer) make a declaration that they are not persistent. The antiforgery infrastructure in MVC will look for confirmation that the scheme is not persistent.
