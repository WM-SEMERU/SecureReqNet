Check for CSP changes in the manifest and flag them for reviewers


We should warn for all CSP changes made to the manifest so reviewers know to check and make sure there are appropriate.
Certain CSP changes should be straight-up not allowed; others should warn developers and reviewers.
This will solve a lot of security issues.
