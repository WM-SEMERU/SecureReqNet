[Validator] IdenticalTo only usable for objects not arrays


Description
With the current state of the validator package its a pain to validate arrays.
For example all the IdenticalTo, EqualTo validators have a propertyPath option which is only usable for objects.
So I dont have any possibility to validate an value based on all inputs values because CallbackValidator does not pass the whole input but only the value.
Given the following example:
$constraints = [
  new Assert\Collection([
     "fields" => [
        "password" => [new Assert\NotBlank()], 
        "passwordConfirm" => [new Assert\IdenticalTo(["propertyPath" => "password"])]
  ])
];

//PasswordConfirm should be matched against password but isnt
$errors = Validation::createValidator()->validate(["password" => "123456", "passwordConfirm" => "54321"]);
Implementing something equal with Callback does also not work because I have to know the input when defining the constraints which allows no abstraction.
$data = [/* ... */]
$constraints = [
  new Assert\Collection([
    "password" => [new Assert\NotBlank()],
    "passwordConfirm" => [new Assert\Callback([
       "callback" => function($value, $context, $payload) use ($data) {   //use-statement here will make problems

       })
     ])]
  ])

];
