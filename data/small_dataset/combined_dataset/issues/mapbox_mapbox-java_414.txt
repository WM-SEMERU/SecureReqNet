MapboxDirections.Builder requires unnecessary generics


The builder is defined as,
public static class Builder<T extends Builder> extends MapboxBuilder
and has no subclasses.
The usage examples in the unit tests are,
MapboxDirections client = new MapboxDirections.Builder()
  // ...
  .build();
which produces a warning due to raw types, e.g.
MapboxDirections.Builder is a raw type. References to generic type 
MapboxDirections.Builder<T> should be parameterized.

The client-side solution is to either suppress the warning or fulfill the contract,
MapboxDirections client = new MapboxDirections.Builder<MapboxDirections.Builder<?>>()
Both of these are ugly, with suppression a little less so as the above is ridiculous.
Since the generics serve no purpose, please remove them.
