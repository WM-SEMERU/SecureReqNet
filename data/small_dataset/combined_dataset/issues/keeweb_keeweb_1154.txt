WebDav MOVE Destination Header


Describe the bug
WebDav Move Destination Header should be relative
To Reproduce
Setup a reverse proxy with https and forward the request to the keeweb backend (http)
The WebDav MOVE Destination will be set to https://...
This cannot be processed because the backend (http) requires starting the destination header url with http://... otherwise it will not find the destination and refuses with Bad Request 400
Expected behavior
The destination header should be set relativ to /
Then the protocol or any rewrites/proxy manipulations will not affect this mechanism.
