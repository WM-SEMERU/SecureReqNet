I've read the permissions docs and they don't seem to jive with reality.

I'm running 7.6.2 CE and there are no public projects in my instance. I created a test user with no memberships in any projects or groups. This user can download and clone any repo in the system, even private ones!

With CE is there no way to enforce a strict level of privacy for certain projects? If I want to invite developers in to my instance how can I prevent them from 

* finding all of my private projects via search 
* browsing/downloading/cloning their source?
