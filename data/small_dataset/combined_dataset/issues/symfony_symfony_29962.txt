References in PO translation files


The PO translation file format supports references, so that one can easily see where the message is used in the source files. This can be very helpful when translating.
The PoFileDumper does not support references. It would be really nice if this could be implemented.
The format is:
#: path\to\file:line
#: path\to\other\file:line
msgid untranslated-string
msgstr translated-string

For example:
#: lib/error.c:116
msgid "Unknown system error"
msgstr "Error desconegut del sistema"
