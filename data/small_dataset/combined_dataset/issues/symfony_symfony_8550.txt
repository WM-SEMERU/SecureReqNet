Voter doesn't receive the current object


I'm trying a simple copy/paste from the official cookbook
If I try to see the class of current $object,
// myBundle/Voters/ClientIpVoter.php

class ClientIpVoter implements VoterInterface
{
    // ...
    public function vote(TokenInterface $token, $object, array $attributes)
    {
        var_dump($object);
        // ...
    }
}
I'm always getting a NULL $object
How can it be explained (and/or debugged) ?
