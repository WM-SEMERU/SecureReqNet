Clarify form_login versus simple_form


From this discussion: #4606 (comment)
There, I say:

Is the only difference between form_login and simple_form the fact that simple_form requires the authenticator key?
If that's true, the we could potentially have an addendum/note to this chapter that says something like:

If you have a form login, but need to do something custom to check the username
and password validity (e.g. call out to an API or have a third field - e.g. accessKey
in your login form) then you can use the very similar simple_form with a custom
authentication [link to custom_password_authenticator.rst].
We just need to clarify if my assumption above is correct. And if so, add the given note (and maybe also clarify in the custom_password_authenticator.rst entry that simple_form has identical configuration to login_form, except for the authenticator key.
