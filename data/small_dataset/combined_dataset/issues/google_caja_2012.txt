Content of iframe's not loading


Hi there,
I have been trying to use Caja. I cannot force it to load the content of iframes.
Example code for a playground:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4jgPdGrZYI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It's seems like Caja doesn't load the iframe content even when URL of the resource does not violate the URI policy.
Docs are not too friendly, so maybe I am missing something.
I found the issue which suggest to turn off the iframe's content loading by default because of security reasons, but it is labeled as started so I think it is propably not finished yet.
