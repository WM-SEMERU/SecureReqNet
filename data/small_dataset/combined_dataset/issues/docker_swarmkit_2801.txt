[18.09 backport] Include old error-message for backward compatibility


Backport of #2797 for 18.09
cherry-pick was clean
Commit 2061af7 (#2779) fixed the API returning incorrect status codes, but also changed the error message for conflicting service-names to be in line with other objects (secrets, configs); "service XX already exists".
Unfortunately, there are existing consumers of the API that perform string-matching, and changing the error-message resulted in a breaking change.
This patch prepends the ErrNameConflict error-message to the error-message, so that those consumers still find the original message, but preserves the enhancement made in 2061af7 (inclusion of the conflicting service name).
With this patch applied, the error message will look like this;
name conflicts with an existing object: service myservice already exists
