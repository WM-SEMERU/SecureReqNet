"Open in New Tab" opens in new private tab, from normal tab


Description
Steps to Reproduce
I'm not sure how to reproduce this issue in a new session window, but it is definitely occurring right now on my machine, including this tab which I have just opened, but wasn't occurring in this tab moments ago - could have something to do with switching between tabs?. I have had private tabs open in this window/session, and have had a lot of different tabs opened and closed.
It seems to be intermittent.
Also occurs on middle mouse click.
Actual result:

Expected result:
Middle click and right click->Open in New Tab should open a new tab which records browsing history etc.
Reproduces how often:
Small? I often leave browser windows open for extended periods of time without killing the program. I'm unsure at which stage this began occurring.
