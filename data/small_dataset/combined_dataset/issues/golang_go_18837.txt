net/http: document filepath sanitization for ServeFile


This is a petty formulation issue, but the subject is quite sensitive so I thought I would bring it up. The documentation for http.ServeFile(w ResponseWriter, r *Request, name string) states that name needs to be sanitized to prevent ascension into parent directories. It further states that ServeFile rejects requests that contain ".." as path elements.
I assume the implication of both statements combined is that patterns like
http.ServeFile(w, r, filepath.Join(".", r.URL.Path))
http.ServeFile(w, r, filepath.Join("dir", r.URL.Path))

are "safe" in the sense that ascension into the respective parent directories is not possible.
However this is not obvious from the current documentation as there may more obscure ways of ascending than ".." that are less obvious (I am honestly not sure).
Imo it would be a good idea to state explicitly whether the file path in the above patterns is sufficiently sanitized or not because I see only two scenarios:
-If the patterns above are not safe the current documentation may cause security problems
-If the patterns are safe some users won't take advantage of this great function because it is not explicitly stated (this is me right now).
