XSS on Login Page


Hello Team,
I found a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Bug in the Login page.
Steps to Reproduce:

Install Frappe and after installation
Access the server for me im running (localhost:8000)  and Go to Login Page
Insert this malicious script "><script>alert(document.cookie)</script> to user field
and the XSS will trigger.

Remedy:
In general, spending time on input validation and output sanitization and escaping will make your application safe.
