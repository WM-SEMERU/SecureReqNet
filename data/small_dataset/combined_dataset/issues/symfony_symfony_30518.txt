This is slimmed down version of: #28269 (many of the fixes there are already part of 3.4)
Does:

Adds test coverage for Predis with RedisCluster
Removes usage of key versioning when on RedisCluster, besides performance aspect of that it simplifies / aligning clear() handling across all clients
reuse doDelete() from clear to make sure we call singular del calls when in predis cluster
