Current behavior
Using vulnerable features like setting a url in a style attribute such as background-image, with custom values that by extension are safe, get rejected because of the Sanitizer detects them as unsafe.
Expected/desired behavior
We should have a way to edit the Sanitizer's RegExp, so we can use our own Sanity checks.
What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?
Although it opens a new vulnerability for non-experienced devs if they change the approved-by-everyone safe RegExp for a vulnerable one, it gives more responsability to the developer.
Imagine one simple case: for [style.background-image], we want to provide a placeholder image just in case the URL we want to show is not available / gets a load error.
The current sanitizer's RegExp is: /^url\(([^)]+)\)$/. This RegExp allows for a single url value, such as:
<div [style.background-image]="'url(' + myImage + ')'"></div>

But that RegExp prevents us from using:
<div [style.background-image]="'url(' + myImage + '), url(./path/to/placeholder.png)'"></div>

Although if the first one is safe, then the second one should be safe as well.
I was thinking about submiting an Issue + PR for changing that RegExp for one that fits this need, but then I thought... Maybe it'd be better if the API allowed to set custom RegExp for sanitizer checks.
