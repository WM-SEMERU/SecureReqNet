Unit tests should stop calling sudo kill


In tests/functional/plugins/base.by the _kill_ports function looks like this:
  def _kill_ports(ports):
      for port in ports:
          p = Popen(['sudo', '/bin/kill `sudo lsof -t -i:%s`' %str(port)],\
                  stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, shell=True)

This is not good, very scary actually, and should be rewritten into something that does not require sudo access at all.
