There is no group check in scan


Case
Given two users Alice and Bob.
Alice is in moco group while Bob is in "experiment" group. If marketplace.mozilla.org is added to both groups, then Bob can see Alice's scan on marketplace.
Problem
We are not honoring group at all. Scan only keeps a record of user who initialized the scan and the target url. We can of course do a AND filter in permission check.
Here is a hypercritical snippet:
if user in group and if target_url in group
This might not be efficient. A better approach is to check and add the group user wish the scan fall under. This mean we have to do some radical changes.
Solution
The quickest solution is to do the inefficient check above. I mean inefficient because it requires me to pull out all the groups that contains the site and do a check. It might not matter for a few people.
The best approach is take group when POSTing a scan. This sounds like we really should have a permission layer based on group. I would like to see a clean display of results for different groups. We should be able to view a scan started under group A and.or started by group B.
