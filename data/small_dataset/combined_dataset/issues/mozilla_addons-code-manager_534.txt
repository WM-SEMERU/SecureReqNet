An error occurs when trying to change the "new" version in the Compare page


Describe the problem and steps to reproduce it:

Go to https://code.addons-dev.allizom.org/en-US/compare/502955/versions/1541794...1541798/
Select a "new" version, e.g., 1.4.0

What happened?
It crashes.
What did you expect to happen?
It does not crash.
Anything else we should know?
Error in local dev is:
TypeError: version is undefined
render
src/components/DiffView/index.tsx:205

  202 | 
  203 | return (
  204 |   <LinterProvider
> 205 |     versionId={version.id}
      | ^  206 |     validationURL={version.validationURL}
  207 |     selectedPath={version.selectedPath}
  208 |   >

Selecting another "old" version seems to work.
