x/tools/cmd/gopls: no reply to shutdown request


What version of Go are you using (go version)?
go version go1.12 linux/amd64

Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
yes
What operating system and processor architecture are you using (go env)?
go env OutputGOARCH="amd64"
GOOS="linux"

What did you do?
Emacs (lsp-mode) hangs when closing a go file. The problem seems to be caused by the fact that in the current implementation:
https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/0fdf0c73855bae8482c5d3907a9e06f33ff70a10/internal/lsp/protocol/server.go#L79-L86
gopls does not reply to the shutdown request.
What did you expect to see?
According to the specification gopls should reply to the shutdown request.
Adding the following to the code fragment linked above solved this problem.
 else {
	conn.Reply(ctx, r, nil, nil)
}
This is just a quick workaround. The error should also be sent to the client and more importantly the server should reject other requests in between shutdown and exit with an InvalidRequest.
