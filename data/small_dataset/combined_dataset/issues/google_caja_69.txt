Members in ___OUTERS___ not whitelisted


Original issue 69 created by mikesamuel on 2008-02-12T06:09:02.000Z:
We don't currently prevent access to implicit members of _OUTERS_.
These members include eval, watch, and unwatch on Firefox.
The current code
eval('alert("foo")');
cajoles to
.asSimpleFunc(___OUTERS.eval)('alert("foo'"));
This doesn't lead to a directly exploitable vulnerability, since we never
mark eval as a simple function, but being able to get a handle to eval
might still allow mischief.
