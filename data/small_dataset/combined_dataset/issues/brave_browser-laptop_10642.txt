Describe the issue you encountered:
Superhuman attempts to create an iframe, but fails due to CSP restrictions. This appears to set-off a chain of additional errors.

extension_frame_api.cjsx:29 Refused to frame 'chrome-extension://dcgcnpooblobhncpnddnhoendgbnglpn/superhuman.html#src=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.superhuman.com%2F~backend%2Fbuild%2Febb9cb1b6c6759bbb27d.extension_frame.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self' https: data: blob: ws:". Note that 'frame-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.

Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?):
Desktop
