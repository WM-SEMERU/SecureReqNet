I wanted to push something to show the advancement and get feedback.
I pushed two versions : one with dedicated functions for code clarity (DebugClassLoader.php) and one withtout (DebugClassLoader___.php). It would be nice if some people with Blackfire could compare the performances.
So let's be clear, we are never gonna be able to cover all cases! We can however cover the vast majority.
Current non covered cases and problems :

We assume that if there is more than 2 returned types, we cannot do anything. Even if it could technically be possible.
We assume that any returned type that doesn't fit our "returnable" types list is a class. We don't check at all if this class actualy exists.
We don't handle spaces in types. The types stop at the first space.
That means we don't handle (yet) the callable type with spaces (cf #29969)
Vendor code extending other vendor core triggers the deprecations ðŸ˜•
