_gel('foo').bar fails due to firefox 2.x hasOwnProperty bug


Original issue 51 created by felix8a on 2008-01-30T17:28:41.000Z:
the symptom is, something like _gel('foo').bar cajoled in firefox will
often generate a delayed exception "Illegal operation on WrappedNative
prototype object" in caja.js hasOwnProp().
what happens is:
_gel('foo').bar when cajoled
calls canReadPub(foo, bar)
calls isJSONContainer(foo)
calls directConstructor(foo)
calls foo.hasOwnProperty('proto')
proto for any dom node is an XPCNativeWrapper, and that triggers the
hasOwnProperty bug.
the bug is here
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=375344
it's still broken in firefox 2.0.0.11.
it should be fixed in the next release of firefox 2.x.
it's fixed in firefox 3 beta 2.
caja.js tries to workaround the problem in canCallHasOwnProperty(), but
that only checks for HTMLDivElement, so it's still possible to get the
exception with code like this:
<span id="foo">abc</span>
<script> _gel('abc').bar; </script>
