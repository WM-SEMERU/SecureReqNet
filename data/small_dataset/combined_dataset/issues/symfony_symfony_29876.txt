[WebProfilerBundle][DX] Where are the deprecation messages coming from?


Example:

Now I want to help and fix all of them by creating pull requests to the corresponding bundles.
But which bundles are affected?
I click on "Show trace":

Ok, stof/doctrine-extensions-bundles is one of them. There is already a PR for this, so nothing to do for me.
So how do I get the other affected bundles? Do I have to wait for the fix in stof/doctrine-extensions-bundles to see the next affected bundle?
