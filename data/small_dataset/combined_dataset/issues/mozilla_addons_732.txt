Context
Chrome extension developer accounts were compromised in 2017 resulting in malicious addons being pushed to Chrome users. This could have been prevented by 2FA.

Firefox Accounts
Since Q1, FxA has the capability to require certain logins to go through a verification loop.
This verification loop can be done by email where the user has to enter the codes we emailed them. ( See Bug 1432189 )
Alternatively, as of this week, for increased security, it is possible to force users to enable 2FA via TOTP. For example, this will be forced for IAM team's integration of FxA into Auth0.
Description
Enable at a minimum email confirmation loops for developer accounts.
If desired, force developers to turn on TOTP. (increased friction over checking an email due to effort to setup)
