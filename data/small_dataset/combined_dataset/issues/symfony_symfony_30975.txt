[HttpClient] CurlHttpClientTest::testHttp2Push is not executed


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.3-dev
Description
The unit test Symfony\Component\HttpClient\Tests\CurlHttpClientTest::testHttp2Push() is never executed. The reason for that is that the used annotation @requires extension curl 7.61 targets the version of the curl extension (which is usually equal to the php version) and not (as it probably was intended) the version of the libcurl library.
How to reproduce
Run the test suite with php 7.3.4 and libcurl 7.61
Possible Solution
Remove the annotation (and fix the red test).
