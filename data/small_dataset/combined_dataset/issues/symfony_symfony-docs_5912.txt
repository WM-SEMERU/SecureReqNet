Ambiguity on Access Decision Manager's Strategy


There currently two articles concerning the AcessDecisionManager's Strategy, the one from the Security Component and the One from the Cookbook. Reading the description of the _affirmative_ strategy, I noticed that these two don't match. The one from the Security Component states:

grant access as soon as any voter returns an affirmative response.

which means make the decision as soon as any voter _grants_ OR _denies_ access.
But according to the one from the cookbook:

This grants access as soon as there is one voter granting access.

Which is self explanatory but is in contradiction with the former description of this strategy.
I have found this latter description to be Correct.
