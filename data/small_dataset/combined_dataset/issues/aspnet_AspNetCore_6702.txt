Question: ASP.NET core 1 and 2 difference in OpenIDConnect cookie


I have asked this question on stackoverflow also but didnt get any answer
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54186959/asp-net-core-1-1-2-openid-connect-cookies-not-being-created-on-redirect-set-coo
I had an issue with oidc cookie not being stored in browser for client application, even though set-cookie header was being sent. I have this system running for more than a year on same settings and had no issues until today.
System Info:
.NET Core 1.1
SSL enabled on both Client and SSO application.
Different sub domain for Client and SSO application.
Response Header in .NET core version 1.1

To solve this issue i had to upgrade to .NET core 2.0 which had a bit different cookie header
Response header .NET core version 2.0

Now the cookies gets stored in browser and work as intended.
The difference I see is Core 1.1 doesnt have path=/sigin-oidc; secure in the cookie.
I have no clue why this would have been issue until now.
