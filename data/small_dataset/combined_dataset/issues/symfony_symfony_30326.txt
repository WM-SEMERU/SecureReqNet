Following #30236 I've prepared two additional addons for the ghost.
The first one will display a plus on February 29, to indicate it's a leap year.

The second one will display a gift on October 18, to indicate it's Symfony's birthday.

I would just like to point out that the addons are purely for fun, to amuse every hardcoding Symfony developer and offer a chance to smile on these few selected occasions.
