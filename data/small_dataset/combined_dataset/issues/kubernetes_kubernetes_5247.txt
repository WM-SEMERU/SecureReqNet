Not all clusters support the same security model


There are two cluster security models in use today in getting started guides

Auth-based:

nginx proxy is exposed to the internet.
nginx proxy does basic auth of users.
kube-apiserver does authentication and authorization of users
kubelets/kube-proxy use tokens to auth to apiserver
the salt-based distros use this model


Network-based:

if you can reach the apiserver, then you are authorized
apiserver (hopefully) not expose to the internet.  Either only serves on local machine, for single-physical machine clusters, or you have to tunnel/vpn to reach the cluster network.
Other distros, such as CoreOS-based ones, use this model.



For now, having the more relaxed Network-based model for some distros is fine.  At some point, we will want to bring all distros listed on our site up to a common standard of security.  This issue is a reminder to do that.
Also, I will add some documentation about this current state of affairs.
