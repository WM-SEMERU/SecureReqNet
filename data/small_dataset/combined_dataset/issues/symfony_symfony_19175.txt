[Security][Guard] Per authenticator configuration via security factory


This is first a question, since there is no real documentation for this component yet.
In Guard, the end user can use several authenticators per firewall, that is something nice.
The problem is that we can't define any extra configuration per authenticator.
I mean that we don't have any alternative to the classic SecurityListenerFactor but per authenticator.
Does providing this feature (extra configuration per authenticator) can be envisaged?
If it is, I can work on.
Otherwise, is there any alternative?
For a real use case, please see lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle#184 (comment) and the (very light) code that comes with.
ping @weaverryan What do you think?
