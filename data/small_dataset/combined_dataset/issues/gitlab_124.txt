I've received conflicting feedback on how useful this is, but I figured I'd mention it anyway. BitBucket project overview pages show your README.md very prominently. GitHub also shows your README, but sticks it beneath a file listing. GitLab's overview doesn't show it at all - it just has the activity stream.

The activity stream is really useful for contributors and developers, but less so for random people trying to grab source code and make sense of it. As a compromise, we capped the activity stream to a smaller size and displayed the README immediately below it:

It's not a great compromise though.
