Fix #1002: Update dependencies for Xcode 10.2


Fix #1002
This change updates the dependencies so that Brave can be built with Xcode 10.2. I have confirmed that, with this change, Brave now compiles without errors on my machine with Xcode 10.2 and works fine on an iPhone with iOS 12.2.
Specific changes:

All dependencies are updated to the latest version that both 1) compiles with Xcode 10.2 and 2) uses Swift 4.x.
None of the dependencies have been updated to versions that use Swift 5, so Brave can still be built with Xcode 10.1.
Some dependencies have not been updated in a long time, so I switched to forks of them that are still being updated.
Travis CI now uses Xcode 10.2. Removed the --no-ri --no-rdoc options on the gem update statement because they have been replaced by --no-document (see bundler/bundler/pull/6624). Travis CI was failing because the options have been removed.
Carthage now uses Swift 4.2 (this is also included in PR #1004).
