Remove unused env vars exception


This behavior is causing problem in the KnpSnappyBundle. If I set false to any of the resources i got this annoying exception.
Ex:
knp_snappy:
    pdf:
        enabled:    true
        binary:     '%env(WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH)%'
        options:    []
    image:
        enabled:    false
        binary:     '%env(WKHTMLTOIMAGE_PATH)%'
        options:    []

I don't want to use the image one, but it's not possible since I got the following exception:
Environment variables "WKHTMLTOIMAGE_PATH" are never used. Please, check your container's configuration.
I think it's better remove this exception than handle the problems it brings.
It's the same asked in the following issue:
#23520
