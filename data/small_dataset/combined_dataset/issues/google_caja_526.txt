IMG USEMAP= is not sanitized properly


Original issue 526 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-11T23:28:27.000Z:
In the Cajoler: IMG USEMAP= is subject only to the constraint that it start
with a # character.  (See html4-attributes-defs.json.)  Currently, nothing
seems to prevent one Gadget from listing a value of the form #xxx where xxx
refers to a name defined by some other Gadget or by the container.  The
intent appears to be that the value of the USEMAP attribute should be
treated as an IDREF and hence name-mangled or whatever to ensure that one
Caja applet can only refer to its own names.  However this does not seem to
be implemented yet.
In Domita: The value of the USEMAP attribute is subject only to constraint
that it be rewritten like any other URI (per the UriPolicy).  This is not
consistent with what the Cajoler requires: Domita allows you to specify
USEMAP attribute values that the Cajoler does not allow you to specify.
There is no Domita restriction that the value of the USEMAP attribute start
with a # character.
In general, it seems that html4-defs.js should be generated based upon the
html4-*-defs.json schemas, perhaps with additional constraints.
