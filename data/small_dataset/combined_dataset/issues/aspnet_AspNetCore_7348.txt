OnRedirectToLogin Event Not Firing


Whenever unauthorized. it returns 302 redirects perfectly. But .net core OnRedirectToLogin event is not firing (I want to change response status).
Is any other setup required? I have posted question on stackoverflow as well. Not sure if .net core has issue or identity server or my code.

My startup file is similar to below sample repo file. In addition to below, I have added global authorize filter and vueclimiddleware and code for 302 to 401 ajax response status convert. other than that it is same as below.
