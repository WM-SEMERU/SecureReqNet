Adding permission for can_only_access_owned_queries


SUMMARY
Adding an optional restriction on query search to only allow users to access their own queries. Right now query search lets anyone access any queries. That would be the default for all roles, but if a deployment wanted to change to restrict users to only search their queries they could do that with the can_only_access_owned_queries permission.
With can_only_access_owned_queries in OBJECT_SPEC_PERMISSIONS, this permission is not added to any role by default.
