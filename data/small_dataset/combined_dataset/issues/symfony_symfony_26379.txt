To check if a user has changed in a security context, my User entity implements the EquatableInterface. Because the logout_on_user_change is set to true, I expect the user to be logged out if the isEqualTo method returns false. This is indeed the case, but only the session cookie seems to be reset and not the REMEMBERME cookie, causing the user to be logged back in. I consider this to be a security flaw and not consistent with manually logging out (e.g. /logout URL), in which the REMEMBERME cookie does get deleted.
It seems like an issue for this already exists, but was closed as fixed in 3.4.0.
This is from my log files:
[2018-03-01 01:43:10] request.INFO: Matched route "account". {"route":"account","route_parameters":{"_controller":"AppBundle\\Controller\\AccountController::accountAction","_route":"account"},"request_uri":"https://example.com/account","method":"GET"} []

My security config is pretty basic:
