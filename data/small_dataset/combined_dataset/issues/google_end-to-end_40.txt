Switch to OpenPGP.js as a PGP encryption stack (already audited and community effort)

Is this report about the crypto library or the extension?
crypto library
What is the security bug?
The current crypto library implementing OpenPGP stack for end-to-end is relatively young and unaudited.
To improve the security of the platform, it's suggested to integrate and switch OpenPGP.js http://openpgpjs.org/
OpenPGP.js has been already audited https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/wiki/Cure53-security-audit and it's used by known client-side-crypto applications such as Mailvelope https://www.mailvelope.com/ .
Additionally OpenPGP.js is now being used by multiple-teams and projects around the world with a good "community effort" .
By having a multi-stakeholder approach to the development of an encryption library for OpenPGP.js that's already used by other projects, would benefit the security of the end-to-end project but also the community at large.
Would you join the mailing list list@openpgpjs.org on http://list.openpgpjs.org/ to introduce a discussion on possible integration?
