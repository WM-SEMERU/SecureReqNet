New-HPOVLdapDirectory (2.0.530.0) -- Invalid credentials to connect to the directory


Please fill in as much information as possible to help resolve your issue.
Expected Behavior
New-HPOVLdapDirectory adds the directory without fault.
Actual Behavior
Follow-up on #126
New-HPOVLdapDirectory cannot add the directory.
If a directory is added through the WebUI and then removed, either through WebUI or POSH, a new directory can be added through New-HPOVLdapDirectory without fault.
Feels like it needs to be broken in using the WebUI first. Very strange. But this explains why it has worked intermittently for me, as I've been configuring new installs using cmdlet/UI alternatively. Whenever I've tried with the UI it'll work afterwards, and whenever I never use the UI (which is what I'm intending for my install script), it'll never work. Cannot wrap my head around why this is happening though.
Steps to reproduce

Create a new appliance and do the basic config of password/hostname/IP. Nothing else.
Do Connect-HPOVMgmt
Do New-HPOVLdapDirectory. For me, this will give "invalid credentials"
Add a directory using the WebUI instead.
Remove the added directory using Get-HPOVLdapDirectory | Remove-HPOVLdapDirectory -Confirm:$False OR remove it using the WebUI
New-HPOVLdapDirectory works.
