Do not share the attributes cache in object normalizer when using a different setting for the ignoredAttributes setting.
In Symfony 4.2, the setter is deprecated in favor of the ignored_attibutes option in the $context. When merging this up, we will however still need to respect the field as well for BC, the cache key does not look at the default context (apart from the deprecated modifiers, the default context is immutable)
There might be performance regression for some use cases, but also could be a performance improvement when using 'attributes' in the context with lists of objects of the same class.
