I think mapping of LDAP group information is a common enough use case that it should be considered to be added to core:

That being said, I would also like to see the addition of a query command line tool to help debug and test LDAP configurations. As such I am wondering if such more "advanced" features should not live in a separate Bundle? Obviously the logic would still be in the component, so I guess there would not be a lot left to put into said Bundle, so maybe its fine to add this stuff into the SecurityBundle.
