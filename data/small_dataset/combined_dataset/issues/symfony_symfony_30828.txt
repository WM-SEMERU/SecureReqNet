It happens when I add
* @ORM\JoinColumn(nullable=false)
in Post Entity and try to make a migration.
I have previous migrations in my folder and some data made with Fixtures in a database. And that seems to be the problem (?)
I've found info that the thing is that foreign key prevent from making changes, as they can make a mess in the structure (but doesn't check that)
How to reproduce
Possible Solution
I had this problem a couple of times. Sometimes I got back to the point of making entity and then I made everything as I want it to be eventually... (but it creates other problems)
I think that once I just dropped the database, deleted all migrations and filled it again.
Unfortunately, none of those solutions will work on a big project and what's more important... Even if I make it work - I still don't really understand what is the problem and where this foreign key comes in (I thought I can somehow drop/delete this key in migrations files but there are just SQL statement so... I don't know what am I doing basically)
