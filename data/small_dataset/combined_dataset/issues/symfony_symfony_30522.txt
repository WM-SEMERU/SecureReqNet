When searching for autowiring class :
If the class not found the command return exception [ERROR] No autowirable classes or interfaces found matching "fake"
But After adding the option all to the command ( To shwing no aliased services), if someone search for no aliased services without the option all. the command command will return empty result and not exception.
I suggested if someone adding search argument. the command must return the aliased and no aliased services. I think it would be better to return the aliased and no aliased services for devs.
