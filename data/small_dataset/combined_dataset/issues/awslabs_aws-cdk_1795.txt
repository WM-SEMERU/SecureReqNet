Cleanse output of `cdk doctor` from known/probable credentials


The output of cdk doctor will list all environment variables with a name starting with AWS_ as those might influence the workings of the application.
We need to redact the values for the environment variables known to be used for credentials, as well as probably any environment variable name that looks passwords-y (contains "password", or "pass", or "passwd", for example).
