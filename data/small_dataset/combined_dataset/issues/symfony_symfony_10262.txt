[Security] Use Form component for form authentication


I've decided to use a model and a FormType for my Login form. This works great and is in my opinion a lot neater than the default approach in the docs (with the manually typed inputs etc...).
However, it seems to me that it's impossible to validate the form. By validating the form, I mean adding constraints on the Login model and having them validated with $form->handleRequest($request); if ($form->isValid()) .... This could be powerful as it would allow you firstly to make sure no empty credentials are checked and also because you could validate a username (e.g. it must be a valid email).
I'm going through the code and as far as I can tell Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener would have to be coupled with the form component. I understand why this is not the case at the moment.
Is it possible to create a different Listener, one that is coupled with the Form component?
