### Problem to solve

A log of failed and successful logins are currently available in the Admin area, but not available as a metric.

### Proposal

Add support for recording login attempts to [session.rb](app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb).

 * Failures
 * Successes
 * 2fa?
 * API token uses?
