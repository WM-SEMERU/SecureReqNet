- in username replaced by _ for the in-memory provider


When a username contains a - for a user managed by the in-memory provider, it is replaced by a _ when processing the configuration as it is a key in YAML files. This make the user provider fail.
The following config creates a user named my_user instead of my-user:
security:
    providers:
        default_provider:
            users:
                my-user: { password: admin, roles: [ 'ROLE_ADMIN' ] }
The workaround is to use the following, relying on the useAttributeAsKey of the configuration:
security:
    providers:
        default_provider:
            users:
                - { name: my-user, password: admin, roles: [ 'ROLE_ADMIN' ] }
I'm not sure this can be fixed easily. So maybe we should just document it so that people use dashes in the username will know the workaround.
