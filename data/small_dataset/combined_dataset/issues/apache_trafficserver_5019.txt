s3_auth:fixed uncaught exception on invalid input


Instead of fixing the URI decoding functionality to handle the exception
(re)implemented a check for percent encoding which was what was needed.
During signature calculation AWS avoids URI encoding of already encoded
query parameters (rfc3986#section-2.4 says "implementations must not
percent-encode or decode the same string more than once ...")
