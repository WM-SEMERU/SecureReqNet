o/ me again.
This requires and is built on top of #30708
When you deploy, all workers need to be stopped and restarted. That's not currently possible, unless you manually track the pids and send a SIGTERM signal. We can make that much easier :).
Now run:
bin/console messenger:stop-workers

And it will signal to all workers (even if they're distributed on other servers) that they should stop, once they finish processing their current message. This is done via a key in cache.app.
Cheers!
