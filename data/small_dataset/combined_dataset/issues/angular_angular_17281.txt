fix(http): don't add XSRF tokens to absolute URLs


Adding XSRF tokens to all external URLs is broken behavior:

It is unreasonable to expect a third party server would validate
a token from another domain.
It leaks the token to domains which may not be secure.
It breaks CORS for origins which don't allow the X-XSRF-TOKEN header.

Fixes #15052
