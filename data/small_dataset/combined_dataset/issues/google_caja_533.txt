Prevent abuse of browser issues that let modules tell whether you've visited another site


Original issue 533 created by collin.jackson on 2008-06-12T00:10:07.000Z:
Modules can exploit the browser features described in the various dependent bugs of
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=412525> to find out what sites you've been to and
can also time the cache to find out what images and other resources other modules are loading.
These communication channels allow covert communication between modules and leak private
information. It might be worth trying to rewrite modules to prevent these channels.
To prevent visited links from leaking your history, it's not sufficient to block getComputedStyle --
the site load images and may be able to trigger other observable side effects using the :visited CSS
selector.
