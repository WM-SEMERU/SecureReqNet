x/tools/internal/lsp: handle rangeFormatting on files that do not parse


If we don't check a package's parse errors before formatting, we may encounter a case where we delete code on format.
Repro:
package foo

func _() {
	f(),
	f()
}

To handle this, we check the parse errors before formatting. However, we should confirm that these errors belong to the file in question and lie within the specified range before failing.
