umask setting is ignored for some directories


Expected Behavior
All directories created by npm install should have the npm config setting umask applied to their file mode/permissions. The umask setting is clearly described as the "value to use when setting the file creation mode on files and folders."
Observed Behavior
During npm install, if directories are created by the tar module as a side-effect of extracting a file, the umask setting is ignored. For example, when tar extracts foo/bar/baz.js, it creates the foo and foo/bar directories (if they don't exist) before writing baz.js. These directories do not respect the umask setting.
Instead, npm's umask setting is ignored and process.umask() is used. However, there is a further bug/unexpected behavior where the tar module will actually do the equivalent of chmod a+x on directories created as a side-effects of file extraction, meaning the even process.umask() isn't strictly observed.

OS: Mac OS X 10.9.5
npm --version: 2.13.5
node --version: v0.10.40
npm config get umask: 0077
umask: 0077

An example is seen if you install grunt-lib-phantomjs. The directory node_modules/phantomjs/lib (as an example) should have a mode of 0700; instead, it has a mode of 0711.
