WIP: Set docker opt separator correctly for SELinux options


What this PR does / why we need it:
The current code for the security context provider uses a hard-coded : separator for the docker security options, while newer versions of docker require = for a separator.  There is code the apparmor and seccomp that sets the separator correctly based on the docker API version, but it is not applied to SELinux options.
Which issue this PR fixes
