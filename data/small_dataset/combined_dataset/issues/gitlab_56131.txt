### Summary

The "Results of GitLab application Check" previously requested with the bug template (accidentally removed?)'s _sanitized_ `gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true` command did/does not sanitize the LDAP users out, potentialy leaking private information.

### Steps to reproduce

`gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true` on an ldap-enabled gitlab server

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

ldap users leaked in the output

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

ldap users redacted out
