### Problem to solve

As well-articulated in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/36568, we should warn users who are using potentially unsafe passwords. Password reuse is common, but potentially unsafe. We should encourage users to use strong, unique passwords when accessing GitLab instances, especially when using GitLab.com.

### Proposal

* When a user logs into GitLab with a password, we should be able to check that password against a list.
* If the password is found in the list, display a banner informing them that they should change their password.
