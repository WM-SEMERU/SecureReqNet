WebTorrent: Restrict torrent server to same origin


Before this PR, another origin could make an XHR or fetch request to the localhost torrent server URL, if they could guess the server address + port + url, which isn't very hard through enumeration.
This would require a torrent tab to be open and actively torrenting, and a malicious script on another origin (and in another tab) to also be active. It would reveal the raw bits of the torrentÂ contents (i.e. video content, etc.) to the malicious page, violating the same origin policy.
Relies on this new WebTorrent option: https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/pull/1096/files and on webtorrent-remote 2.0.2.
