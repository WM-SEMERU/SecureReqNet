BUG REPORT
Versions
kubeadm version (use kubeadm version):
1.13.5
What happened?
I was updating cluster from 1.13.3 to 1.13.5.  When I do a yum install kubeadm-1.13.5 from official yum repository it wants to install kubelet 1.14.0 as a dependency.
Updating:
 kubeadm                         x86_64                  1.13.5-0
Updating for dependencies:
 kubelet                         x86_64                  1.14.0-0
 kubernetes-cni                  x86_64                  0.7.5-0

What you expected to happen?
kubelet dependency should match kubeadm version at 1.13.5
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
yum install kubeadm-1.13.5
