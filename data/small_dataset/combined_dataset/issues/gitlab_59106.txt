The gem `doorkeeper-openid_connect` has a (low-risk) open redirect vulnerability which was fixed in version 1.5.4, and was assigned [CVE-2019-9837](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9837).

The upgrade also requires upgrading Doorkeeper to version 5.x, I saw there's an [old MR upgrading to 4.4.3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/21576).
