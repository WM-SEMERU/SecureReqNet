CIS Compliance for kubeadm


Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?
FEATURE REQUEST:
I'd like to start working on some of the default configuration that kubeadm generates for the manifest files. Currently, the defaults aren't especially secure.
The CIS benchmarks for kubernetes are publicly available, and a lot of the issues with a kubeadm generated cluster can be fixed by updating the default configurations here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kubeadm/app/phases/controlplane/manifests.go
Some of these configuration options require a bit more work than others to enable, but some (like audit log configuration) are very simple to get started with.
Any thoughts welcomed.
