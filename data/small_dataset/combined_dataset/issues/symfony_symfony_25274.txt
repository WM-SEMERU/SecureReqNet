The security.authentication.guard_handler service is actually meant to be available for users to use. Specifically, the authenticateUserAndHandleSuccess() method is useful to auto-login the user after, for example, registration, but maintain all the behavior of a normal login (success behavior, trigger the login event).
So, it should have an autowiring alias.
