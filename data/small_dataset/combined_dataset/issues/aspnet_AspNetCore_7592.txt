Why is the NotAuthenticatedWithFailure message logged as INFO, not ERROR?


Usually, we search log file for ERROR or WARNING whenever it has issues.  It happens sometimes I see no ERROR in the log but my application has issue because the data protection key is messed up.
Why is the NotAuthenticatedWithFailure messaged be logged as INFO, not ERROR or WARNING?

2019-02-14 11:40:07,711 -08:00 INFO  [CookieAuthenticationHandler] MyApp.Cookies.Auth was not authenticated. Failure message: Unprotect ticket failed [0HLKIM6U10MO2:00000003 44600:106]

Should this line  use LogLevel.Error or LogLevel.Warning like this?
            _authSchemeNotAuthenticatedWithFailure = LoggerMessage.Define<string, string>(
                eventId: 7,
                logLevel: LogLevel.Error,
                formatString: "{AuthenticationScheme} was not authenticated. Failure message: {FailureMessage}");
