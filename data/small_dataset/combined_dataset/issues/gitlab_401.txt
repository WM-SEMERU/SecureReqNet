1. **Summary:** When clicking the Reply button in a Merge Request diff (or anywhere a comment can be replied to), if the click occurs inside the ``icon-comment`` icon inside the Reply button, then the comment form spawns *inside* the Reply button.
1. **Steps to reproduce:**
    * Create a new Merge Request
    * Make a comment on a line of code in the MR diff tab
    * Click the icon-comment icon inside the Reply button for that original comment
      (you should see that the form has replaced the icon-comment icon, inside the button)
    * Refresh the page
    * Click the "Reply" text inside the Reply button for that same comment
      (you should see that the comment form is now in the right spot, under the button)
1. **Expected behavior:** When I click anywhere on the Reply button, whether it's on the ``icon-comment`` icon or the text, I
   expect the same behavior: the Reply button should disappear and the comment form should appear where it used to be.
1. **Observed behavior:** When I click the ``icon-comment`` icon, I see the comment form spawned inside the Reply button, where
   the icon used to be; subsequent clicks (e.g. clicking Write or Preview) in the form causes more forms to be spawned inside
   the existing form.  This was confirmed in Firefox 30.0 and Chrome 35.0.1916.153 m
