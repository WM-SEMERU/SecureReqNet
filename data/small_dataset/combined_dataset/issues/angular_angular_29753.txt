ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom is creating shadow dom but not encapsulating component from external css


üêû bug report
I have a simplest possible angular component. The only difference is that I have encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom enabled. Doing this is creating shadow dom as expected. But its not protecting component from external styling.
For example I have following styles in style.css
*{
  font-size: 30px;
  color:red;
}

This style is being applied to divs inside the component.
