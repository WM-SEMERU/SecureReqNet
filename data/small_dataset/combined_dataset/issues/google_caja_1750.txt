Host object leaked without being tamed: "valueOf()"


Original issue 1752 created by erights@google.com on 2013-06-01T18:23:20.000Z:
In the playground, in ES5 mode, cajole
<script>
alert(valueOf());
</script>â€‹
Expected the imports or scope object to appear in the alert. (ideally it would be "undefined", but I didn't expect that.)
Instead, nothing was alerted. In the "Runtime Messages" tab I see
&quot;Uncaught script error: 'TypeError: Host object leaked without being tamed' in source: 'https:' at line: 1&quot;

I don't yet know which host object leaked, but I fear the worst. Hence this quick private report.
