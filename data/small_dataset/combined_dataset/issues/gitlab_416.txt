As you can see on the [markdown help page](https://gitlab.com/help/markdown/markdown.md#emoji), some emoji are not tranlsated to images but left as their text. Juging by the first look, it seems that the emojis in the [emoji gem](https://github.com/steveklabnik/emoji/tree/master/assets/images) work, but on [emoji-cheat-sheet.com](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/), there are way more listed.
