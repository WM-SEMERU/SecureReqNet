When an unordered list is created inside of a note in an issue or MR, the bullets are displayed at level-2 depth to start (i.e. the white/hollow bullets instead of the expected black bullets).  This looks to be because the notes are themselves ``li class="note"`` tags, which makes any child unordered lists rendered as nested lists.  See the 1st note below as an example of the issue.

This was observed as early as version 6.7.3 (f88d30f) and in the current version 6.8.1 (fbae5eb).
