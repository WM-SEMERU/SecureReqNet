x/vgo: "cannot find module providing package"


What version of Go are you using (go version)?
$ go version
go version go1.11.5 darwin/amd64

$ vgo version
go version go1.11.5 darwin/amd64 vgo:devel +b0a1c5df98


Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
Yes (I just installed vgo today)

What did you do?
I have a file myfile.go with contents:
package mypackage

import (
	"github.com/docker/docker/errdefs"
)

I can use go get successfully to fetch the errdefs package needed above:
$ go get -v github.com/docker/docker/errdefs
# success

But using vgo build fails:
$ vgo build
go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/PullRequestInc/testvgo
go: finding github.com/docker/docker/errdefs latest
myfile.go:4:2: unknown import path "github.com/docker/docker/errdefs": cannot find module providing package github.com/docker/docker/errdefs

My guess it has something to do with either:

The weird way this package in github redirects to moby. (It's unclear to me how go get looks up these dependencies)
Possibly the fact that there's not an errdefs.go file in https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/errdefs

Note that I don't encounter this problem when importing other related packages:
import (
	//"github.com/docker/docker/errdefs"
	"github.com/docker/docker/api/types"
        "github.com/docker/docker/api/types/container"
        "github.com/docker/docker/client"	
)

What did you expect to see?
I expected vgo build to succeed.
What did you see instead?
vgo build failed with error:
myfile.go:4:2: unknown import path "github.com/docker/docker/errdefs": cannot find module providing package github.com/docker/docker/errdefs
