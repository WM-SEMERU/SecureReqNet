[Validator] Improve URL validator pattern




The current pattern used in URL validation constraint allows invalid URLs.
Pattern ([\pL\pN\pS\-\.])+(\.?([\pL\pN]|xn\-\-[\pL\pN-]+)+\.?) for domain allows to pass domains like
-a.com which are invalid according to RFC 1035 domains can't start and end with the hyphen.


\p{M} is allowed and should be added to pattern.  aÌ€.com will be transformed to xn--0ca.com


Also, what do you think about adding TLD pattern check?
