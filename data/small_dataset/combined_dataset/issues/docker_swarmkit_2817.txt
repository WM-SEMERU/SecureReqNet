Add validation to CredentialSpec configs


- What I did
Adds validation assuring that if a service uses a Config as a CredentialSpec, then the Config is included in the ConfigRefs with a RuntimeTarget.
- How to test it
Includes a test case, which I verified fails before this change and passes after.
