Review mbedtls module configuration options


Open Enclave currently uses all default configuration constants for all the enabled features in mbedtls as documented in config.h:
/**
 * \name SECTION: Module configuration options
 *
 * This section allows for the setting of module specific sizes and
 * configuration options. The default values are already present in the
 * relevant header files and should suffice for the regular use cases.
 *
 * Our advice is to enable options and change their values here
 * only if you have a good reason and know the consequences.
 *
 * Please check the respective header file for documentation on these
 * parameters (to prevent duplicate documentation).
 * \{
 */
We should explicitly have GregZ review this choice as the set of mbedtls options have shifted slightly since his original review, but there should not be a lot of churn here.
