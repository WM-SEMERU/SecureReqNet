[DX] Improve error message when security.yml is incomplete


The other day I had some problems helping a Symfony newcomer debug her first application. She configured the security.yml file, created the user entity, etc. but when she tried to log in the application, she got the following error message:
security.INFO: Authentication request failed: Your session has timed out, or you
have disabled cookies.

After discovering the error, I tried to reproduced it in a fresh Symfony installation and this was the error message that I got:
Authentication request could not be processed due to a system problem.

Which was the problem? She configured her user provider as follows:
security:
    providers:
        users:
            entity: { class: AppBundle:User }
Do you see the problem? The property option is missing:
security:
    providers:
        users:
            entity: { class: AppBundle:User, property: email }
Could we improve the error message in this case? Has anyone faced other security problems with misleading error messages?
