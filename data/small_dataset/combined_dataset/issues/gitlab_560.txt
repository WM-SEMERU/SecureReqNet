It would be great if in the project 'Admin area' that it was possible, on public access projects to allow anonymous users to submit issues. Perhaps with the addition of a name field where the user can volunteer an identity if they wish but need not request an account on the server. Clearly, this is not in line with the typical model of transparency and accountability of git/gitlab but it might be quite useful in some projects.
