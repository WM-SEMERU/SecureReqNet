I have been using the BRAVE DEV browser. As of yesterday (03/31/19) I had a total of 2.10 BAT tokens in my BAT wallet that I had received through rewards/ viewing ads. Today (4/1/19) I opened my BRAVE DEV browser and tapped on rewards settings. The 2.10 BAT that I have received is gone. I checked my UPHOLD account and the 2.10 BAT is not there. I went to the BRAVE community help page and looked for similar issues. I found some posts however they did not answer my inquiry. I am a bit disappointed because I would like to participate in BRAVE rewards but not if the BAT are going to go missing. It is not the 5th of the month which is supposed to be payment date. Please help.
