Need another form of DOM attenuation: this node doesn't communicate info from the user to event handlers


Original issue 579 created by erights on 2008-06-13T00:17:13.000Z:
Reported by David Wagner.
Say gadget A shared a read-only attenuation of dom node D with gadget B. B
inserts D into its own tree. User clicks on D in its rendering in B,
triggering event handlers previously posted on or within D. All so far is
as it should be.
However, there are hazards and opportunities here. The hazards are:

A may not have realized that user actions within gadget B may now
trigger A's handlers.
B may not realize that accepting and inserting D into his own tree
provides A's handlers ui events from the user's interactions within B.

Say that we have a form of attentuation, like the sensory (transitively
read-only) attenuation we currently support. Perhaps it's an additional
flag. Perhaps it's an additional implication of the flag we've already got.
A can now guard against hazard # 1 by providing an attenuated D to B.
B can now guard againts hazard # 2 by inserting into its own tree an
attenuation of the D it receives from A.
