Hi,


I've install the GitLab 7 and everything is working fine.

Except the email function.

At the Background Jobs tab, on the Retries tab is see this kind of error:
```
OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: hostname "mail.host.com" does not match the server certificate.
```

Is there and step that I can apply to solve this problem?

Thanks.
