307 internal redirects to go-updater.brave.com still send network requests to Google


In chrome://net-internals, there are requests to Google domains such as https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx?os=mac&arch=x64&os_arch=x86_64&nacl_arch=x86-64&prod=chromiumcrx&prodchannel=beta&prodversion=70.0.55.10&lang=en-US&acceptformat=crx2,crx3&x=id%3Doemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm%26v%3D0.0.0.0%26installedby%3Dpolicy%26uc%26ping%3Dr%253D-1%2526e%253D1 which show a response of 307 (internal redirect) to Location: https://go-updater.brave.com/extensions?os=mac&arch=x64&os_arch=x86_64&nacl_arch=x86-64&prod=chromiumcrx&prodchannel=beta&prodversion=70.0.55.10&lang=en-US&acceptformat=crx2,crx3&x=id%3Doemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm%26v%3D0.0.0.0%26installedby%3Dpolicy%26uc%26ping%3Dr%253D-1%2526e%253D1, which is expected
Since these are 307's, I would expect no network request to the original clients2.google.com URL. however this appears to not be the case.
STR:

download wireshark for your platform
follow the steps in https://jimshaver.net/2015/02/11/decrypting-tls-browser-traffic-with-wireshark-the-easy-way/ to log the TLS session keys for Brave and import the keyfile into wireshark.
close brave, delete the profile directory.
start a wireshark capture and then start Brave
stop the capture after about 20s. look for requests with destination 172.217.164.110 (the IP for clients2.google.com)
inspect the decrypted SSL data for these requests with protocol http2. you should see one that looks like this:
