internals: send body as postform instead of querystring


Fixes #3.
Send the body as a post form so make a url.Values
from all the secrets to send, then make a request
whose body is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
Yesterday's solution didn't settle right with me
and after reading
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections
that drove me to fix this in class.
Now the body will be sent in the body and secrets won't be inspected
when encrypted.
