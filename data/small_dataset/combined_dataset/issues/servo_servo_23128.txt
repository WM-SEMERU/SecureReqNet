Pass not none value in setfullscreen


Diagnose
Entering fullscreen mode is passing None value to Window when set_fullscreen function is called which prevents
Servo actually entering fullscreen mode.
In addition, the function exit_fullscreen in document.rs is passing True value to
SetFullscreenState which doesn't allow to exit from fullscreen mode.
Solution

Instead of passing None value when FullScreenState is true, window.get_primary_monitor() is called in order to pass a monitor id.
This fix make Servo actually enter fullscreen mode.
Changed SetFullscreenState to false when exit_fullscreen function is called.
In addition, added new implementation to support exiting from fullscreen mode by pressing Escape button.

Testing Plan
After my change in windows.rs and document.rs,
the Servo app can enter/exit fullscreen mode.
In addition, the ESC button support
allows to exit from fullscreenmode.
