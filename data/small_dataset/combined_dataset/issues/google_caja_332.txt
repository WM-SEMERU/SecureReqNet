Confirm caja.def statically checks type of 1st argument, not second


Original issue 332 created by ihab.awad on 2008-05-30T18:51:14.000Z:
Pls confirm that, given 1st class ctors, caja.def(...) now no longer needs
to check the type (function, declared function, ...) of either of its
function args (representing the subclass and superclass).
