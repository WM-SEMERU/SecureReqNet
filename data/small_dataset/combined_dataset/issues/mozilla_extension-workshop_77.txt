Add security headers to 404s


The staging site is only failing the security baseline on 2 things - good work team!
Both of them are missing security headers on 404s:

Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set

curl -I https://extensionworkshop.allizom.org/rubbish
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Connection: keep-alive
x-amz-error-code: NoSuchKey
x-amz-error-message: The specified key does not exist.
x-amz-error-detail-Key: rubbish

Can these be added?
Its not a blocker to going to production but would be good to fix these soon.
