The deprecation is triggered only if the class implementing \Serializable does not already implement the future serialization mechanism (with __serialize and __unserialize).
The case we don't handle (yet) is if your class implements an interface that extends \Serializable.
Needs #30965 and twigphp/Twig#2927 for tests to pass.
