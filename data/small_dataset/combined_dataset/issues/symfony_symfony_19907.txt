[Security] access_control host option can't be trusted?


There's a few options to match the access_control rule and host is one of them: http://symfony.com/doc/current/security/access_control.html#matching-options
This all looks fine but it gives the impression you can grant or deny access by matching the host. Sadly this value can be spoofed and doesn't do a reverse dns lookup (which would probably slow everything down by a lot).
While matching on host can be nice, especially for routing, I don't think this has any place in the access_control as it can lead to security issues.
Case: I had a page which should've only been visible from the internal network. Someone added ROLE_NO_ACCESS unless a certain host was matched. Example from the docs (with host instead of IP):
# app/config/security.yml
security:
    # ...
    access_control:
        #
        - { path: ^/internal, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY, host: some-internal-domain\.com }
        - { path: ^/internal, roles: ROLE_NO_ACCESS }
This looks secure and would mean you don't have to work with IPs (as they can change in theory). The problem comes when you have this on a public website (think of liip monitor bundle for example). While it looks safe, with a simple hostname spoof, you're in. I don't think this option should be in the access_control as is (and possibly not even the firewall).
Or am I mistaken and did I miss something?
