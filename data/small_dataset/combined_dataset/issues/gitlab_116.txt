Public project links are viewable by anonymous users, but if you get a link to a group, you will be asked to sign, even if the group has public projects.

We're trying to make our GitLab installation as public as possible, so we've rejiggered the UI and controllers around making it more accessible. Unfortunately - I didn't know we'd be going this far, so I don't have any clean merge requests. I'm trying to re-assemble our patches though.
