Virtually add Function.prototype.bind() to caja.js for caja code


Original issue 242 created by erights on 2008-05-02T23:43:28.000Z:
Yet another element from the obsolete erights/first-class branch that needs
to be revived for trunk.
By "virtually add", we mean: use the fault handler so that it appears to be
there for Caja code but is absent for uncajoled Javascript code.
