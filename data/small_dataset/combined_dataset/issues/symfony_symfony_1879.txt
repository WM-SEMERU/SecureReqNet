$_format is lost on failure_forward


I've been debugging this for the past few days but to no avail.
This is the excerpt from my security file:
security:
    firewalls:
        default_json:
            poshtar_login:
                login_path: /login.json
                check_path: /login.json
                failure_forward: true
            context: store
            anonymous:  ~
            logout:     { path: /logout }
            pattern:    /.*
            provider:   poshtar

What I was able to figure out using a debugger is that the content type for subresponse? is set correctly to json, but sometime later, when responses get merged? and the request is asked again for a format the request returns html as the attributes bag is empty (controller resolver set the proper format in subrequest) so data sent to the browser has a wrong content type.
