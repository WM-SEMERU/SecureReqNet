Document the contract of each component that performs a security-critical task


Original issue 608 created by zestyping on 2008-06-14T00:05:34.000Z:
For example, for the HTML sanitizer, specify what "sanitized HTML" consists
of.  And so on, for each component that makes some sort of security promise:
clearly specify the security promise so that a reviewer or maintainer can,
given example input/output, tell whether the component has succeeded at
upholding its promise.
