Add "search events" web API method.


This PR adds a new web API method for searching audit events. This new method will be used by the new audit log page. Web API already has a method that was misleadingly named "siteEventsGet" but it is used for session player and thus returns only session events and has some extra logic around processing them.
Adding this method also required adding a read-only permissions for events to the default admin role, otherwise events can't be read. This, in turn, required a migration to add missing "events" permissions to all roles which already have permissions to access "session".
