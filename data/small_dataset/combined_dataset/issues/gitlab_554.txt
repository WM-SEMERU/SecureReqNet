I just noticed that when I edit a markdown file from the main git repository, the editor highlights the markdown syntax: headers, lists, emphasis, etc.

I also use a lot the wiki pages to produce markdown, but in that case, the editor does not provide any language support.

It would be nice to provide also in the wiki page editor support for markdown syntax.
