3.0 ForgotPassword regression in AzureB2C templates


aspnet/Security#1887 added a new AccessDenied feature that breaks the ForgotPassword flow from 2.2.
From @Tratcher
Ah, this was a new feature to standardize error responses: aspnet/Security#1887
It looks like B2C used to handle this error themselves in OnRemoteFailure. This logic would need to move to the new OnAccessDenied event.
