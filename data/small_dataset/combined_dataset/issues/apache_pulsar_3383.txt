refactor AuthorizationProvider interface to allow custom logic for determining super user


Motivation
Currently the logic for determining if a role is a super user is not pluggable.  Thus, users have to specify who is a super using the the configuration of a broker which is hard coded.
Making the logic of determining if a role is a super user pluggable while allow users more flexibility in setting super users which can be a dynamic list of users held in an external source.
Modifications
Made the mechanism of determining super users pluggable
