proposal: x/crypto/chacha20poly1305: add support for XChaCha20


Currently golang.org/x/crypto/chacha20poly1305 only supports the IETF ChaCha20, which has a nonce size of 96 bits. However, according to the folks from libsodium, this nonce size is too short to allow you to use random nonces.
However, XChaCha20 (which has an extended nonce size of 192 bits, but uses the same underlying construction from my non-cryptographer understanding) has a long enough nonce that random nonces are safe. Here's the quote from libsodium:

Unlike plain ChaCha20, the nonce is 192 bits long, so that generating a random nonce for every message is safe. If the output of the PRNG is indistinguishable from random data, the probability for a collision to happen is negligible.

Is there any interest or plan to implement XChaCha20 support? I've found some third-party libraries, but I don't trust them as much as I'd trust golang.org/x/crypto maintainers.
