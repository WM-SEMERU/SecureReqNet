archive/zip: sanitize the FileHeader.Name to remove path traversal ("../../") from zip files?


Go isn't directly affected by path traversal attacks in archives but programs written in Go might be.
In particular, if a Go program reads a malicious zip file, the archive/zip package will return the malicious filename in the FileHeader.FileName.
Perhaps we should sanitize it?
If we really need the raw/unsanitized version, we could copy it to a new field FileHeader.InsecureFileName or RawFilename or something.
