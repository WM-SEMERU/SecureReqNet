[Security] Option to trim password


Why PasswordType has option to trim value, but UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener doesn't?
Example: We create sign-up form with password input, which has option trim => true (We decided to trim password), customer is entering (space)my very secure password(space), so as result he will get my very secure password (encoded of course) in database.
So why we don't have same ability to trim password for logic_check?
