Hm, safe ads... You know that an iframe with srcdoc attribute is considered first-party and the same-origin policy isn't stopping it from accessing its parent? So, unless you also add a sandbox attribute, the ad frames you are injecting are just as unsafe as the ones you blocked. Want to actually sandbox them?
For reference, I'm talking about this code: 


browser-laptop/app/content/webviewPreload.js

 // ref param for referrer when possible
