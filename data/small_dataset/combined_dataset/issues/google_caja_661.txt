DefaultCajaRewriter should not use 'instanceof'


Original issue 661 created by ihab.awad on 2008-07-29T00:24:26.000Z:
The current DefaultCajaRewriter uses 'instanceof' to check the class of
nodes it is accepting. This means that any subclasses pass through
unnoticed. Hence anyone can write subclasses upstream of the rewriter and
tunnel through stuff that renders to any strange weirdness.
DefaultCajaRewriter and all similar TCB code should be checking for exact
class matches on its inputs, not 'instanceof'.
