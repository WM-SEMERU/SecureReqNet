Possible vnodeID conflicts with APFS


Hi,
When browsing over your Driver Code I noticed that you combine the File System ID with the File ID to one 64 bit Vnode ID.
This worked fine with HFS/HFS+ since it restricted itself to use only 32bits for the file id. But If I'm not mistaken APFS takes actually advantage of all 64 bits.
Are you ok with this conflict?
Best Regards
Timo
