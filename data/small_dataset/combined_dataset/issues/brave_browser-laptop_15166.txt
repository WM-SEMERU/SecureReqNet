Legitimate video skipped on CNET


Description
Brave seems to skip the first CNET video, regardless of whether the site is set for autoplay or not or Brave has ad blocking enabled or not.
Steps to Reproduce

Open https://www.cnet.com/news/t-mobile-will-deploy-blazing-5g-this-year-but-you-cant-use-it-yet/
Play video to lower right of screen

Actual result:
The first few seconds of the first video are shown, then it skips to the next video in the CNET sequence. If ad blocking is disabled, the ad shows but the video still only shows the first few seconds.
Expected result:
First video shows.
Reproduces how often:
100% for me
