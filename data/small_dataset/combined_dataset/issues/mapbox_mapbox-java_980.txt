add @Keep annotations


One of the typical issues we hit downstream, is integrating a mapbox-java dependency in an Android project using proguard. Since we generate jar files as binaries from this repository, we can't include a proguard mapping file. As a result we need to maintain the proguard mapping  downstream while ideally this is done in this repository instead.
An alternative way of providing proguard integration is using the @Keep annotation. This is used by proguard at compile time to determine to not obfuscate a method/class/.. etc.
This issue tracks looking into adding this @Keep annotation.
