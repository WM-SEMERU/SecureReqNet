"Fix pagination when over 25k add-ons


Fix #3887

This PR fixes the Paginate component to not display more pages than allowed by the API. Currently the API can return up to 25k add-ons. If we go over this limit we get a 404 (for example with 25 add-ons per page we can navigate up to page 1000 and page 1001 will 404).
The diff is larger than expected because I updated the test file.
