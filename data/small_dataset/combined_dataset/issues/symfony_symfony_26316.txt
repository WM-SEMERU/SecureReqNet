Symfony version
3.4


Due to deprecation warnings I replaced stuff in security/firewalls, security/providers.



Actually the substitutuion of '{username}' in dn_string of the firewalls doesn't seem to have any effect anymore.




https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/security/ldap.html suggests the following:
# app/config/security.yml
security:
    # ...

    firewalls:
        main:
            # ...
            form_login_ldap:
                # ...
                service: Symfony\Component\Ldap\Ldap
                dn_string: 'uid={username},dc=example,dc=com'

if I place
dn_string: 'CN={username},OU=Users,DC=my,DC=domain,DC=de'

{username} won't be replaced.
see the Exception:
LdapException
HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
Could not complete search with dn "CN={username},OU=Users,DC=my,DC=domain,DC=de", query "(&(memberof:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=CN=MyGroup,OU=Groups,DC=my,DC=domain,DC=de))" and filters "*".

Looking at the code there is something different happening to dn_string then to query_string.
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.4/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DependencyInjection/Security/Factory/FormLoginLdapFactory.php#L37
For now I'm fine with removing CN={username}, from the config, but either it's a bug/issue or a wrong documentation.
