Browser navigation may allow theft of form data from other gadgets


Original issue 525 created by collin.jackson on 2008-06-11T23:27:44.000Z:
What steps will reproduce the problem?
Attacker module is above Victim Gadget in the same page.
Victim module has a form with secret data.
Attacker module reloads the page, or navigates it to a page that calls
history.go(-1).
Attacker module creates a form on the second load of the page.
What is the expected output?
Attacker's module does not receive secret data from the Victim module.
What do you see instead?
Attacker's form is automatically filled with data from the Victim module's
form.
This behavior is highly browser-dependent -- Safari seems to work better
with history.go(-1), while Firefox works better with location.reload(). The
test bed isn't convenient for reproducing this test case due to all the
other form fields present on it.
Firefox test case (using uncajoled code) is at
