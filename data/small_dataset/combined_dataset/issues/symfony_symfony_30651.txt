Currently, the project directory is defined by the location of the composer.json file.
That file is not required in production, which therefore breaks the method getProjectDir (who sends back null).
The offered solution, while working, requires the developer to implement it, and uses inheritance override, while a more aesthetic solution could be used.
This does not fix the behaviour, but allows the developer to pass the project dir as a parameter.
While this solution does not include BC break or anything, it is important to notice that it includes
an optional parameter.
Object instantiation in the framework bundle recipe could be updated as follow (in another PR):
$kernel = new Kernel($_SERVER['APP_ENV'], (bool) $_SERVER['APP_DEBUG']);
$kernel = new Kernel($_SERVER['APP_ENV'], (bool) $_SERVER['APP_DEBUG'], dirname(__DIR__));
