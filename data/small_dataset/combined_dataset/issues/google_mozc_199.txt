[IBus 1.5.4][Security] ibus-mozc must be locked down on the Gnome Shell's locked screen


According to the following thread, ibus-mozc should support 
IBus.InputPurpose.PASSWORD so that IME can be disabled even when an application 
simply puts GTK+ "input purpose" as PASSWORD instead of explicitly disabling 
IME.

>> 1. Is there any user-visible problem expected when an engine doesn't support 
IBus "input purpose", especially on gnome-shell password dialog?
> If the engine does not support the input purpose, the typed chars are shown 
on the password entry.
> And in case that engine is Japanese, Hiragana on preedit may be shown on 
preeedit by default.

>> 2. Why was it OK for an engine to do nothing when it works with IBus 1.5.3 
and prior?
> 1.5.2 or lower do not handle the input purpose so the typed chars are shown 
as the bug.
> 1.5.3 returns FALSE when the input purpose is password in IBus GTK+ IM 
modules instead of sending the key events to IBus engines so the problem does 
not appear.
> 1.5.4 adds the class method of set_content_type() in IBusEngine and IBus GTK+ 
IM modules send the input purpose to engines.
