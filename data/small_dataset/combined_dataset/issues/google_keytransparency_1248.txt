Add Canonical Err Codes


Add canonical error codes to the errors that may occur during sequencing.
The main purpose of this is to expose a metric that can export the numbers of sequencing errors that are:

InvalidArgument - various kinds of data corruption or user error.
Internal - conditions that we expect to never happen.
