"Encoder" is a Misnomer which Leads to Confusion


Referring to: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Encoder
I saw this thread on StackOverflow, wherein the author is confused about actual cryptography terminology. It seems their confusion is stemming from the naming convention that Symfony uses.
I'd like to refer to my blog post about cryptography terms and concepts (which has been informally peer-reviewed by crypto experts for both semantic and colloquial accuracy and even-more-informally peer-reviewed by neophytes for digestibility).

Cryptography

Keyless

Cryptographic hash functions


Secret-Key

Secret-Key Encryption (e.g. block ciphers, stream ciphers)
Secret-Key Authentication (e.g. HMAC)
Password Hashing


Public-Key

Key Agreement
Public-Key Encryption
Public-Key Authentication - Digital Signatures (e.g. RSA, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA)




Not Cryptography

Compression
Encoding



This might be something that has to be punted to Symfony 4 (assuming Symfony follows semver), but the average Symfony developer's understanding of the correct cryptography terminology would greatly improve if Symfony changed its vocabulary.
This is just something to consider.
