It would be nice to have option to choose what way repo can be accessed: only over HTTP(S) or only over SSH or both. For example I think for public repos SSH link should not be visible (only those who have write access to the repo should see it). 
Or option to set access way to repo (public or private) to choose between HTTP(S), SSH, both...
