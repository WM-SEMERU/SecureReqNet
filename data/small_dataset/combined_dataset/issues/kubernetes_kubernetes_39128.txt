Proposal: spec the seccomp profile format


Seccomp is supported by annotations today in both kubernetes api (#25324) and CRI (#33500):

security.alpha.kubernetes.io/seccomp/container/<container name> for containers
and security.alpha.kubernetes.io/seccomp/pod for pod

The candidate values includelocalhost/<profile-name>, which indicates the profile installed to the node's local seccomp profile root.
So from the API, only the profile path is defined and the profile format is not defined clearly.
Althoughthe docker's seccomp profile format is supposed at the beginng time, we are adding other runtimes by CRI, so it's time to spec the seccomp profile format clearly.
candidate formats
There are three candidate formats in my opinion (please let me know if I missed others):

oci seccomp (also reference runc's seccomp
docker's seccomp: docker's seccomp of v1.10~1.12 is same with oci seccomp, but it introduces ArchMap in v1.13.
define a new one of kubernetes

I prefer to define a new one based on oci seccomp and add ArchMap to it because of

more stable api
and not missing features according different runtimes
