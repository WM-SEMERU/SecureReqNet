When a user has changed own password, I want to logout any sessions which is authenticated by its user except changer itself.
DaoAuthenticationManager::checkAuthentication() method seems to concern about it.
But, this situation actually never happens because both users that will be passed to this method are always identical in re-authentication.
It's because the token refreshes own user via ContextListener before re-authentication.
