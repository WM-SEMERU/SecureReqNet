Documentation should not reference external BCrypt tool


Currently the documentation suggests using this online tool to generate BCrypt hashes.
Although this tool may have been set up with the best of intentions - we have no way of proving that the operator is not farming the input BCrypt hashes (or that the service has not been compromised).
I think these references in the documentation should be removed, as it is not a good security practice to generate password hashes like this.
