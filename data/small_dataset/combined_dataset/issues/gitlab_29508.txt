'When fighting abuse it would be very helpful if an admin could query the API for more detailed information about a snippet, issue, or comment, such as the source IP used to create it. This would make it easier to correlate actions across the instance and multiple abuse accounts. 

For example an admin could query for an abusive snippet, gather the source IP, and then query for all other content created from that IP.
