[Routing] Implement host per locale


Description
Be able to configure host per locale in the same way that we can configure prefix per locale.
Thus we will be able to indicate that the

url beginning with www.website.es matches the locale es (spanish)
url beginning with www.website.be/nl/ matches the locale is nl_BE (dutch of BELGIUM)

History
Prefix/path per locale is possibe from Symfony 4.1. Development has been done in that PR.
Vocabulary used
In www.website.be/nl/offers/index.html :

host:  www.website.be
path-prefix: /nl (can be also named path/folder/directory/prefix)
full-prefix: www.website.be/nl (host + path-prefix = full-prefix)

Configuration
Below are 2 examples of how to configure that, can we agree with one and how it will work ?

Host + path-prefix in same configuration
Set both the host and path-prefix (full-prefix) :

site:
    resource: '../src/Controller/'
    prefix:
        en: '/site'
        es: '://www.website.es'
        nl_BE: '://www.website.be/nl/'
    type: annotation
That above code without es: '://www.website.es' row and ://www.website.be is working in Symfony 4.1
Note that we are using :// to be able to detect later that the configuration is using a full-prefix and not only a prefix-path.
Questions:

Must it begin with :// or //  ?
Extract host from configuration :

starts with ":// => it's a full-prefix (host + path-prefix)
otherwise => it's only a path prefix
in the really specific case that we want to have the following url possible  www.website.com/://www.website.com/site/index.html only specifying the path-prefix the conf will be



[...]
    prefix:
        en: '/://www.website.com/site'

Others solutions to detect that the conf starts with a host ?

regex?
the conf can only starts with

"/" for a path-prefix
"://" for a host or full-prefix
otherwise, it throws a configuration error




What happens when the host is also on the non locale level ? (Eg: @Route(host="www.website.com") or host: www.website.com)
Should we rename prefix:?
In the above configuration what happens if url starts with www.website.es/site ? Throws a configuration error ? Thus mixing configurations will be possible if there is no "host" only configuration.


Host in separate configuration

site:
    resource: '../src/Controller/'
    prefix:
        en: '/site'
        es: '/sitio'
    host:
        es: 'www.website.es'
    type: annotation
Questions:

What happens when both the locale host and non locale host are set  ? Use the 1. locale host - 2. non locale host - 3. Throws an exception

Quick code to implement the feature with 1) conf :
YAMLFileLoader:197
const URL_KEY = '://';
//if the it starts with ://
if (substr($localePrefix, 0, strlen(self::URL_KEY)) === self::URL_KEY) {
  $posFirstSlash = strpos($localePrefix, '/', strlen(self::URL_KEY));
  $localeHost = substr($localePrefix, strlen(self::URL_KEY), $posFirstSlash-strlen(self::URL_KEY));
  $localePrefix = substr($localePrefix, $posFirstSlash);
  $localizedRoute->setHost($localeHost);
}
