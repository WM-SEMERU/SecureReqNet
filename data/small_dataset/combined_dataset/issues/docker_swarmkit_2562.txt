[fips] Remove the GOFIPS env var check


#2246 added FIPS support by checking the environment variable GOFIPS.  This has several drawbacks:

The tests set the GOFIPS env var, and unset them.  When tests run in parallel, this can cause flakiness, which we've seen some of in CI
We won't be able to test to make sure we reject mixed clusters if we require FIPS compliance (see #2544)

Better if we can inject a boolean for FIPSness.
This changes everywhere that used to use keyutils specifically to check for FIPSness now has to take a keyutils.Formatter object which provides the same interface as keyutils used to, and this changes everywhere that called encryption.Defaults to pass whether FIPS is required.
Note that this does not pass the FIPS bool through from node to the raft storage - there's more work that needs to be done there, and this PR is really big already, so I'll do it in a separate PR.
