NullReferenceException from DefaultHttpContext.Abort()


gRPC for ASP.NET Core has an interop test fail: grpc/grpc-dotnet#206
This part of the logs stands out:
Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FeatureReferences`1.Fetch[TFeature,TState](TFeature& cached, TState state, Func`2 factory)
   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.DefaultHttpContext.Abort()
   at Grpc.AspNetCore.Server.Internal.HttpContextServerCallContext.DeadlineExceeded(Object state) in /var/local/git/grpc-dotnet/src/Grpc.AspNetCore.Server/Internal/HttpContextServerCallContext.cs:line 267
   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)

   at System.Threading.TimerQueue.FireNextTimers()

A gRPC request can have a timeout. When a timeout is specified we start a System.Threading.Timer, and call HttpContext.Abort() when it is triggered. If the request app logic completes before then the timer triggers then the timer is disposed.
This is DefaultHttpContext.Abort():

 public override void Abort() 



 { 



 LifetimeFeature.Abort(); 



 } 





What could cause the feature to be null?
