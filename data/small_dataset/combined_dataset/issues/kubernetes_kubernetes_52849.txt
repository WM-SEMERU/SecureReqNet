Prefer non-mutating PSPs, then order by name

Removes unnecessary mutation of pods:

Determines effective security context for pods using a wrapper containing the pod and container security context, rather than building/setting a combined struct on every admission
Does not set privileged:&false on security contexts with privileged:nil
Does not set runAsNonRoot:&true on security contexts that already have a non-nil, non-0 runAsUser
Does not mutate/normalize container capabilities unless changes are required (missing  defaultAddCapabilities or requiredDropCapabilities)

Defines behavior when multiple PSP objects allow a pod:

PSPs which allow the pod as-is (no defaulting/mutating) are preferred
If the pod must be defaulted/mutated to be allowed, the first PSP (ordered by name) to allow the pod is selected
During update operations, when mutations to pod specs are disallowed, only non-mutating PSPs are used to validate the pod

PodSecurityPolicy: when multiple policies allow a submitted pod, priority is given to ones which do not require any fields in the pod spec to be defaulted. If the pod must be defaulted, the first policy (ordered by name) that allows the pod is used.
