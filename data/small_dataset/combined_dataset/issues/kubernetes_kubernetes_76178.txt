Create endpoint/service early to avoid unwanted create/delete volume transaction.


At times, for some reason endpoint/service creation can fail in a setup. As we
currently create endpoint/service after volume creation, later we need rollback
of this volume transaction if endpoint/service creation failed. Considering
endpoint/service creation is light weight, this patch promote endpoint/service
creation to an early stage.
