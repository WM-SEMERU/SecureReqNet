`kubeadm init` should default to a finite token TTL


Versions
kubeadm version (use kubeadm version): <= 1.7
What happened?
kubeadm init created a default token with infinite TTL.
What you expected to happen?
kubeadm creates a token with limited (2 hour?) TTL by default
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
Run kubeadm init without specifying the --token-ttl parameter.
Anything else we need to know?
This was discussed in SIG-cluster-lifecycle earlier today. It should be a trivial fix if we agree on the new default.
