jQuery UI shows datepicker UI elements at bottom of page after datepicker('setDate', ...)


Original issue 1896 created by bradford.carl.smith on 2014-03-02T07:34:05.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?
Whatever version of caja was used by Google Apps Script as of 2014-03-01.
On what browser and OS?
Chrome 33.0.1750.117
running on Ubuntu Linux 13.10
What steps will reproduce the problem?
Minimal example source code is here (readable by anyone):
https://script.google.com/d/1i2E1h-U4929ZGoZvxUMnNpliU1eSHGJMk-vIvoI5z7ncgNbILdxuYVqC/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;splash=yes
Web deployed here (runnable by anyone):

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see just the text box for the datepicker with the current date in it.
Instead the parts of the datepicker's UI are crammed at the end of the page incorrectly formatted.
Clicking the datepicker text box shows the UI properly and it disappears
correctly when the box loses focus.
Please provide any additional information below.
I've used this exact same code in a text file on my machine,
and it works fine there, so I believe the problem is related to
caja on apps script.
