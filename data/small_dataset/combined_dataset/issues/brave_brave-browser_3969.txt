GPU-related artifacts

My Brave experience has become so horrible. A new tab takes 3-5 secs, typing in the url bar has a lag of multiple seconds. While typing, the window turns to garbage.  I deleted ~/Library/Application Support/Brave* and reinstalled and it's the same.
Automatic graphics switching does not have an impact, but I do have more than one GPU card.
Chrome works on the same machine.
It's only a brave issue and for me it didn't start until the Dev release w/ ads. It's actually a 2012 with a GeForce GT 650 running OSX Yosemite. No issues on my other computers. Running Brave immediately turns the fan up to max and I get that weird graphic effect.
