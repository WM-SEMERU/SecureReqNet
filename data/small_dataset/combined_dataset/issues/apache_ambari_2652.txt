AMBARI-24951. Using Ambari CLI to specify which services should be setup for LDAP integration


What changes were proposed in this pull request?
New questions and CLI options have been added to support LDAP integration in Ambari:

Indicating whether to enable/disable LDAP authentication for Ambari itself
Indicating whether Ambari should manage the LDAP configurations for specified services
A comma separated list of services that are expected to be configured for LDAP (it is allowed to use * to indicate ALL services)

How was this patch tested?
By extending existing unit tests with the new scenarios:

In addition to this I executed ambari-server setup-ldap with and without the following CLI options; the tool behaved as expected in all cases and the new data has been saved in the DB:
--ldap-enabled-ambari
--ldap-manage-services
--ldap-enabled-services
Important note: the JIRA indicated that we have to add a new question and CLI option to populate User group member attribute (memberOf) field; this change will come in a separate PR (I did not want to mix it with the service management)
