SeServiceLogonRight is not getting cleaned up after exiting JEA session


My servers are all getting a new entry in SeServiceLogonRight (Log on as a service) for every JEA connection made and they are not getting cleaned up. The SID is S-1-5-94-xxx with the name of "WinRM Virtual Users\WinRM VA_xxx_Domain_UserID" where xxx is the next numeric number, Domain and UserID are for the person connected to the endpoint. I have some servers that have over 500 entries in a few days that only differ by the incremented number (each time an automated process runs it appears to create another entry).
Reference this bug report on JEA where I was asked to create a new one here:
PowerShell/JEA#27
Steps to reproduce
Create a basic JEA endpoint with Session, Role, and Module files, then Register the endpoint.
Run Invoke-Command against the new endpoint several times.
Open up Local Security Policy and see that "Log on as a service" (SeServiceLogonRight) has had a new entry added for each instance of Invoke-Command.
Expected behavior
JEA should remove the ID from the SeServiceLogonRight when the session closes.
Actual behavior
JEA leaves the IDs under SeServiceLogonRight indefinitely.
