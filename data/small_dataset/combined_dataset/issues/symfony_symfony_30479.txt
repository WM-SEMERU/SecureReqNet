The DotEnv component does not overwrite by using environment variables declared in .env files.
In the FrameworkExtension will be checked if the framework.test config is set to a non-false value, if so it will load the test.xml file which contains the definition for the test.client service.
When running php bin/phpunit it will use phpunit.xml.dist but because we defined APP_ENV in our system it will not load test.xml so when creating a client to do functional tests, we'll get an exception which isn't correct: You cannot create the client used in functional tests if the BrowserKit component is not available. Try running "composer require symfony/browser-kit"
This PR aims to add a clearer exception message which indicates what really should be done to fix the error message.
