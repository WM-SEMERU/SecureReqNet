Dear all,
sorry, if iam completely on the wrong path. Iam very new.
Iam using the mssql extension. I've done everything successfull like in the readme. I have created a connection with a query and executed it to an JSON file. Very nice, so far. But where is now the trick ? How is is possible to transfer this to my code, so that the code will do the same for me, automatically ?
