OnInit() called twice


Describe the bug
The OnInit()-event is called twice / handler runs twice
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:


Visual Studio 2019; create new project using Razor components template


In MainLayout.razor add the following to the end of the file:
`@functions{      protected override void OnInit()
{
base.OnInit();
Console.WriteLine("OnInit called");
}
}`


Place a breakpoint on the Console.WriteLine-call in OnInit()


Debug and see in Output -> ASP.NET Core Web Server:
The breakpoint will be hit twice! From what I've read it should only be hit once at the initialization of the component


Expected behavior
OnInit() should only be called once
Additional context
