test_THROWTYPEERROR_UNFROZEN() and test_THROWTYPEERROR_PROPERTIES() don't pass in an ECMAScript6 environment.
test_THROWTYPEERROR_UNFROZEN:

ES6 %ThrowTypeError% has a configurable "length" property (just as every other function).

test_THROWTYPEERROR_PROPERTIES:

ES6 %ThrowTypeError% has poison pilled "caller" and "arguments" properties.
