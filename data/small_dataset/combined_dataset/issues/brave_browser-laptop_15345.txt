Description
I can't get reddit videos and spotify web player to play. I installed Windvine and yes, I can login into spotify now, but it doesn't play the songs - they get stuck at 00:00. The same happens on reddit, because the videos won't play at all.
But if I put the shields down, all of these work.

Steps to Reproduce

Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/nonononoyes/comments/9i5myc/i_think_i_can_i_think_i_can/ and try to play the video with shields up
See that it won't play and disable shields
See that the videos play
Go to https://open.spotify.com/track/4YsFuYyDwfDrUl6bSL6g8H and try to play the song with sheidls up
See that it won't play and disable shields
See that the song plays now
