DomSanitizationService inserts double-quotes inside style statements needing single quotes


For certain styles that require single quotes inside of the double-quoted style statement, the DomSanitizationService is inserting double-quotes, thereby prematurely ending the style string in the browser, making it break.
Steps to reproduce and a minimal demo of the problem
Here is a style string that needs to be used for [style.background-image]="cleanImageUrl"
cleanImageUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustStyle('url(/pImages/' +  this.recipientId + '.jpg)');
Which results in the following being sent to the browser :
style="background-image: url("/pImages/57211a89b65ff1be3edd14c9.jpg");"
Notice the double quotes after url(  , this breaks the style=""  string prematurely and the
image is not being pulled.
I've also tried manually inserting the single quotes:
cleanImageUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustStyle("url('/pImages/" +  this.recipientId + ".jpg')");
But that gives the same result... it replaces my single quotes with double quotes inside the resulting string
Regarding the  cast :
The sanitizer doesn't return a string and  was used because it was recommended to be better than , but ,  and not casting it at all have been tried
What steps should we try in your demo to see the problem?
Try the DomSanitizationService on any style statement that requires single quotes inside of the style statement,  i.e.   style="background-image: url('/path/image1.jpg');"    Even though this will also work without the single quotes at all, the DomSanitizationService inserts double quotes anyway, or replaces your single-quotes with double-quotes.
Expected/desired behavior

Stop inserting double quotes where they aren't needed,  url(/path/image.jpg) works fine, or
Stop replacing the single quotes put into the url with double-quotes,  url('/path/image.jpg'), or
Don't insert or replace double quotes, and let the developer put in single quotes if needed, and if so, ignore them
