[Security] Bump cryptography from 2.2.2 to 2.4.1


Bumps cryptography from 2.2.2 to 2.4.1. This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

High severity vulnerability that affects cryptography
A flaw was found in python-cryptography versions between >=1.9.0 and <2.3. The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.
Affected versions: >= 1.9.0, < 2.3



Changelog
Sourced from cryptography's changelog.

2.4.1 - 2018-11-11

* Fixed a build breakage in our ``manylinux1`` wheels.

.. _v2-4:

2.4 - 2018-11-11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL 2.4.x.
* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.1 support. OpenSSL 1.0.1 is no longer supported by
  the OpenSSL project. At this time there is no time table for dropping
  support, however we strongly encourage all users to upgrade or install
  ``cryptography`` from a wheel.
* Added initial :doc:`OCSP </x509/ocsp>` support.
* Added support for :class:`~cryptography.x509.PrecertPoison`.

.. _v2-3-1:

2.3.1 - 2018-08-14


Updated Windows, macOS, and manylinux1 wheels to be compiled with
OpenSSL 1.1.0i.

.. _v2-3:
2.3 - 2018-07-18

* **SECURITY ISSUE:**
  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.AEADDecryptionContext.finalize_with_tag`
  allowed tag truncation by default which can allow tag forgery in some cases.
  The method now enforces the ``min_tag_length`` provided to the
  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.GCM` constructor.
  *CVE-2018-10903*
* Added support for Python 3.7.
* Added :meth:`~cryptography.fernet.Fernet.extract_timestamp` to get the
  authenticated timestamp of a :doc:`Fernet </fernet>` token.
* Support for Python 2.7.x without ``hmac.compare_digest`` has been deprecated.
  We will require Python 2.7.7 or higher (or 2.7.6 on Ubuntu) in the next
  ``cryptography`` release.
* Fixed multiple issues preventing ``cryptography`` from compiling against
  LibreSSL 2.7.x.
* Added
  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.get_revoked_certificate_by_serial_number`
  for quick serial number searches in CRLs.
* The :class:`~cryptography.x509.RelativeDistinguishedName` class now
  preserves the order of attributes. Duplicate attributes now raise an error
