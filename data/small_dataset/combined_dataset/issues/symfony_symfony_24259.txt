Apologies in advance if this is just operator error but I don't think the security.csrf.token_generator service is being defined.  It used to be defined in the Framework bundle and I don't think it got moved to the Security bundle during the recent cleanup.
composer create-project "symfony/skeleton:^3.3" sec339
cd sec339
composer require console
composer require security-bundle
bin/console debug:container --show-private security # No csrf services

I think it is just a question of moving the security_csrf.xml from the old FrameworkBundle to the new SecurityBundle.
