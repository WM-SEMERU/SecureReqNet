Use includeSubdomains for HSTS on addons-server and addons-frontend.


We don't currently send includeSubdomains for the HSTS header on AMO. We do use includeSubdomains for the pinning though. I don't think there's a reason not to send includeSubdomains for HSTS so we should check the spec and turn it on for both addons-server and addons-frontend.
Issues for the relevant repos should reference this one.
