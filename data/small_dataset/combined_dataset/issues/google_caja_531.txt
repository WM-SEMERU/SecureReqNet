RegExp save static state which can be access by other instances of RegExp


Original issue 531 created by jasvir on 2008-06-12T00:04:16.000Z:
RegExp use static variables input, multiline, lastMatch, lastParen,
leftContext, rightContext, and $1 through $9.  As a result, a RegExp.exec
and RegExp.test which don't take an input string are able to access prior
regexp state and input including matches which happen in a different gadget.
These static variables must be unset before executing a match.
