authentication process, add image of the process, feature


Is it possible to add image of the authentication process, including firewall, acl, tokens, listeners (especially gurad listeners), guards, describing how everything works.
Trying to implement custom 2fa authorization, and now I realise that is really hard to understand the whole process using the code.
