jQuery UI spinner styling wrong in Google Apps Script Caja


Original issue 1897 created by bradford.carl.smith on 2014-03-04T07:21:59.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
Whatever version of caja was used by Google Apps Script as of 2014-03-01.
Chrome 33.0.1750.117 running on Ubuntu Linux 13.10
What steps will reproduce the problem?
Minimal example code is here:
https://script.google.com/d/1TfFbjpqBoVehFA2fMsgH8s_B4xkpTN8lCT1u3kHpYB0yX_rtp8x_L57Q/edit?usp=sharing
Deployed as a webapp here:
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzlvc8ZTXHi-N2qw3IBnIxkWpAducmjgPg7oVurdE-3QRKMpIE/exec
What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see spinner up/down buttons on the right side of the element,
but instead they are huge and stuck on the far right of the window.
(I didn't actually even see them there at first.
They don't really look like buttons.)
Please provide any additional information below.
I've used this exact same code in a text file on my machine,
and it works fine there, so I believe the problem is related to
caja on apps script.
The key board shortcuts for the widget still seem to work fine.
