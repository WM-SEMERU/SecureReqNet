proposal: x/crypto: add support for AES Key Wrap


AES Key Wrap is defined in RFC 3394 (plain) and RFC 5649 (with padding).
The implementation is straightforward and the relevant RFCs come with test vectors.  I have an implementation complete that I'd be happy to submit.  I'd suggest adding it to a package named x/crypto/aeswrap to avoid confusion with the AES data encryption functionality in crypto/aes.
