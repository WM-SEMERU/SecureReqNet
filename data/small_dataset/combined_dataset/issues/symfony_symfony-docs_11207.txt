Documented the local Symfony server


Two comments:

It's entirely based on the great slides published by Fabien at https://speakerdeck.com/fabpot/symfony-local-web-server-dot-dot-dot-reloaded
This is the article that explains the server itself ... but we need to think other possible integrations/mentions in other articles.

Thanks.
