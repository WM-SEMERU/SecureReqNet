Support for vault namespaces


Updated Vault integration to add initial support for Vault namespaces.
Updates to:

Vault configuration stanza (server and client)
Vault client usage on server and client
consul-template configuration
numerous dependencies updates to support this
documentation

Note, the circonus-gometrics dependency in vendors was updated to work with the updated go-retryablehttp dependency. This is relatively low-risk for future updates, because it corrected a compile-error; if some future hypothetical update of circonus-gometrics doesn't compile, it will be pretty noticeable. Also, the change was a trivial function signature change:

There's a question as to whether VAULT_NAMESPACE should be included on the default environment blacklist
Also, this apparently broke the vault e2e test in Travis; an endpoint used in the test suite changed in the Vault API; new versions of Vault are backwards compatible with old clients, but the new vault.api client is not compatible with old Vault servers. This endpoint isn't used in Nomad's Vault integration; it's only present as part of setup in the Vault e2e test suite. This has been modified to bypass the client in favor of a raw request against the previous API when testing against an older version of Vault. (I also added the latest versions of Vault to the test matrix.)
