security concerns creating an https ingress on GCE


Proposal
Allow specifying an existing gcloud TLS cert (via annotations) in the ingress resource.
Security Concern
My current understanding of kubernetes secrets on GCE is that they are stored plaintext in etcd. Using a different secret backend (e.g. keywhiz) seems out of your control on a hosted kubernetes like  GCE.
Requiring the use of a secret resource in the ingress as the only way to create an https LB frontend and proxy is too constraining. As an alternative, if you've already created a gcloud compute ssl-certificate, allowing it to be specified as the TLS cert to use for the ingress's LB cert.
Current bug
If you set the annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.allowHTTP: "false" without the spec.tls.secretName doesn't create an https forwarding (presumably because a GLB frontend requires a tls cert)
