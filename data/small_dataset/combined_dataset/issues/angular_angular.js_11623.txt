sec(http): JSONP should require trusted resource URLs


WORK-IN-PROGRESS.  Do NOT merge.  More work needs to be done and the tests are currently broken.

JSONP should require trusted resource URLs.  This would be a breaking
change but maybe not too onerous since same origin URLs are trusted in
the default config and you can easily whitelist any 3rd party URLs you
trust in one single place (your app/module config.)
fix a bug where $http can't handle $sce wrapper URLs.

Closes #11352
Closes #11328
