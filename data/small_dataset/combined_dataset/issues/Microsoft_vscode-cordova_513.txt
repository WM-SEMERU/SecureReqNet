Hi,
please help localization team to answer question from translator.
In case translator is not sure about context/meaning/localizability of string we raise a question to Core team.
Please re-assign back to use in case you are not the right contact person or you canÂ´t assign to a proper person.
Can you help please?
Thanks!

Device {0} supports only API Level {1}. \r\n Level {2} is needed to support port forwarding via adb reverse. \r\n For debugging to work you'll need <Shake or press menu button> for the dev menu, \r\n go into <Dev Settings> and configure <Debug Server host & port for Device> to be \r\n an IP address of your computer that the Device can reach.
