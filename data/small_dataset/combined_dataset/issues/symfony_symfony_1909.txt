UsernamePasswordToken should accept roles as Collection.


Now we can pass roles into UsernamePasswordToken only as array like
public function getRoles() { return array('FOO', 'BAR'); //sample }
or if for example User ManyToMany Role
public function getRoles() { return $this->roles->asArray(); }
the problem is that second example with is quite common will not work with Forms in Symfony because
$builder->add('roles', 'entity', array('class' => 'Bundle\Entity\Role'))
expects that getRoles method will return Collection.
