Symfony version
3.4.4



Ever since we've updated from 3.3.10 to 3.4.4 we've been getting numerous complaints, next to experiencing it ourselfs, that people are randomly being logged out of the application. The problem seems to occur every hour, but we cannot be sure of that since testing that is a very tedious process.
We actually haven't changed any settings since 3.3.10 that are bound to session management so we're at a loss as to what might be causing this problem. We've removed various bundles to be sure, like the Scheb TwoFactor bundle but to no success.
The log's don't give any hints, besides saying the following:
[2018-03-08 09:37:31] security.INFO: Populated the TokenStorage with an anonymous Token. [] []
[2018-03-08 09:37:31] security.DEBUG: Access denied, the user is not fully authenticated; redirecting to authentication entry point. {"exception":"[object] (Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\AccessDeniedException(code: 403): Access Denied. at vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/AccessListener.php:68)"} []
[2018-03-08 09:37:31] security.DEBUG: Calling Authentication entry point. [] []

Can anybody point me in the right direction? Or might this actually be a bug in the upgrade?
