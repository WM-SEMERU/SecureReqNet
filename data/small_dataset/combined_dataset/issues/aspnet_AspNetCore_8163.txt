Include support for proposed username in WsFederation request


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
While adding ADFS integration to my v2.2 asp.net core application using WsFederation in the Security namespace I found (just lucky) that if I include a query parameter in the request to ADFS named username, the authentication prompt from ADFS will pre-populate the user name.  This improves my user experience because at the time I make this request, I already know who wants to authenticate. I was able to implement this in an event handler override for WsFederationEvents.OnRedirectToIdentityProvider, but I think it would be worth supporting this more natively in the WsFederation (or maybe RemoteAuthentication) middleware.
Describe the solution you'd like
In method WsFederationHandler.HandleChallengeAsync, the instance of WsFederationMessage is built and the parameters sent with this request could be expanded to include the username (and perhaps any other currently unsupported fields), maybe by using key/value pairs from the caller supplied properties. If this is unique to WsFederation maybe this means a new properties class derived from AuthenticationProperties.
Describe alternatives you've considered
I could just continue with my event override but I think you should support the full protocol, even things that are optional for the auth service.  People mostly don't know about these things if you don't have a field for it and this is a great way to document availability of a nice feature.
