is access_control only executed  when there is a firewall matching the path?


security:
	access_control:
        - { path: ^/api/internal, roles: "IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY", ips: [199.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/16] }
        - { path: ^/api/internal, roles: ROLE_NO_ACCESS }

each access control is added into the AccessMap class,the AccessMap is only used in AccessListener,
so I infer  access_control is only executed  when there is a firewall matching the path, is this right?
I want to let a user call   ^/api/internal apis without authentication from these ips [199.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/16] , if the access control is only executed  the user is authenticated, this is not what I want.
