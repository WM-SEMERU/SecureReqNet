Ref: #13589
When consuming a Symfony Form through an API, like manually calling the URL with form data in the URL (e.g.: ?my_checkbox=false or ?my_checkbox=off), it does not work because it interpret those values as true.
We already encountered this issue on 2/3 projects and I'm probably sure we are not the only one.
To prevent this, I think it would be nice to add more false values to the CheckboxType type.
What do you think about it?
Thanks
