As announced today at SymfonyLive Lille, here is the new MIME component.
This PR is one step towards the new Symfony Mailer (announced at Symfony London). It started as a fork of Swiftmailer, but soon enough I rewrote almost everything to make it (hopefully) better and more flexible. I've removed all the complexity of Swiftmailer when it comes to multiparts for instance.
Some big differences with Swiftmailer:

Way less complexity (no crazy dependency injection when not needed, less interfaces, no cache)
Plain data object and no state (out are the observers for charset and encoding, in are POPO and serializable objects)
No magic regarding multipart management, but a nice wrapper for the most common use cases

swiftmailer/swiftmailer#775
swiftmailer/swiftmailer#946
swiftmailer/swiftmailer#615
swiftmailer/swiftmailer#184
swiftmailer/swiftmailer#56
and probably many others
More Symfony-like
Messages are built on-demand and we do not mess up with your headers/body (Swiftmailer add headers and change yours, but here, we generate needed headers when converting the message as a string, they are not stored -- it means for instance that generating an Email twice will give you 2 different Date headers)
and probably more that I don't remember right now

I've also kept some nice features from Swiftmailer like support for any charset.
