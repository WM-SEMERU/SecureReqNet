Post https://sqs.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn/: dial tcp: i/o timeout


Following https://github.com/awslabs/aws-service-operator/#aws-service-operator to complete setup of aws-service-operator.
Checking status as below:

aws cloud formation stack is created successfully
kube2iam works well
[root@ip-172-31-11-185 aws-service-operator]# kubectl get pod kube2iam-hbk7k -n kube-system
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

[root@ip-172-31-11-185 aws-service-operator]# kubectl logs -f kube2iam-hbk7k
Error from server (NotFound): pods "kube2iam-hbk7k" not found

time="2019-03-20T12:25:23Z" level=info msg="Listening on port 8181"
aws-service-operator works well at first but soon failed by the following error:
time="2019-03-20T12:33:01Z" level=fatal msg="RequestError: send request failed\ncaused by: Post https://sqs.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn/: dial tcp: i/o timeout"

I know what that mean, however I could not figure out how to fix this.
Any clues will be really appreciated!
