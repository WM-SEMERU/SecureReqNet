What steps will reproduce the problem?
Replace the ? in the below expression with null bytes and cajole it:
return "</scr?ipt><script>alert(document.cookie)</scr?ipt>";
What is the expected output?
return "</scr\000ipt><script>alert(document.cookie)</scr\000ipt>";
What do you see instead?
Firefox: return "</scr?ipt><script>alert(document.cookie)</scr?ipt>";
IE: return "</script><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>";
The IE version will alert document.cookie.
What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Caja Test Bed. I wasn't able to get the test bed to run on IE, so I'm not
100% sure this attack works, but there should be a test for it regardless.
