This purpose of this event is to be a hook when a message is sent to a transport.
If that message is redelivered later, that's not the purpose of this hook (there
are Worker events for that) and could cause problems if the user unknowingly
tries to modify the Envelope in some way, not thinking about how this might
be a redelivery message.
