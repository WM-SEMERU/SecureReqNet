Preview support for Integrated Authentication on Mac is not working



MSSQL Extension Version: 1.1
VSCode Version: 1.16.1
OS Version: OS X 10.12.6

Preview support for Integrated Authentication (aka Windows Authentication) on Mac is not working. I have a confirmed kerberos ticket but vscode can't access it.
