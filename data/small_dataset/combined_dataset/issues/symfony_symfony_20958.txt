In short, this improves the way how the DaoAuthenticationProvider handles exceptions.
I encountered myself in the following situation:
Event though I throw a DisabledException on my implementation of the UserProviderInterface (pointing that the user status is not active anymore), the DaoAuthenticationProvider would then throw a "generic" AuthenticationServiceException which only provides the user with a "system problem" message even though it's a user status problem.
This pr is a simple, but efficient way of dealing with this issue.
Let me know if you guys agree with this, if yes I will add tests in DaoAuthenticationProviderTest.
Ps: this is my 1st pr on symfony...please be extra patient. ðŸ˜†
