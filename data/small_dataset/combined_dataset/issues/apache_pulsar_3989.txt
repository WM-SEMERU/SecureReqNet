[Question] Geo Replication docs out of date?


The documentation on Geo Replication mentions:

Replication must be used with global topics, meaning topics that belong to a global namespace and are thus not tied to any particular cluster... Global namespaces need to be created in the global virtual cluster.

Is this part of documentation still valid? It seems I can create namespaces that replicate between two clusters (i.e. creating a namespace for a given tenant and then using set-clusters to set both ) without having to use the virtual cluster notation mentioned on this page.. Replication seems to work fine.
