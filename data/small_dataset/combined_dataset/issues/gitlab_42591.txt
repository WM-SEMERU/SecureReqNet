'There is one ~security issue found in the `lixml2` (`2.9.5`) vendored in `nokogiri`: https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1714

- `omnibus-gitlab` **is not vulnerable** since it already ships `lixml2@2.9.6`: https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1714#issuecomment-361113310
- source installation however are still vulnerable since we're currently using `nokogiri@1.8.1`

These issues are fixed in `nokogiri@1.8.2`.

@kathyw Does this need to be fixed in a security release or should we just update the gem in a normal release workflow?
