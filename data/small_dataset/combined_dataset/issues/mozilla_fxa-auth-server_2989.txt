refactor(config): cache repetitive calls to conf.get


This is just a tiny little improvement I noticed we could make while reviewing #2986. Instead of calling conf.get('contentServer.url') inline 12 times inside these template literals, it reads a bit nicer if we assign the result to a variable name instead.
@mozilla/fxa-devs r?
