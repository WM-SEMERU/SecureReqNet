Key mappings wrong/ignored on MacOS Dvorak Qwerty-⌘


Description
On MacOS I use the software mapped Dvorak keyboard with the option to switch back to the QWERTY layout when the Command Key (⌘) is held down.  This works fine in every program I have used except Brave.  In Brave holding down ⌘ does not return the keyboard to the QWERTY layout.  This means that when I forget that Brave behaves this way I often try to cut text in the browser with ⌘X but since the X key is still mapped to Dvorak I'm really pressing ⌘Q and so Brave quits.  Other amusing (but mostly annoying) things happen with other shortcuts.
Steps to Reproduce
1.  Turn on Dvorak - QWERTY ⌘  in Preferences.  Apple Icon > Preferences > Language & Region > Keyboard Preferences...  From the Keyboard Preferences window click the + in the bottom left corner of the window and then select Dvorak - QWERTY ⌘ from the list of English layouts.  Make sure it is the selected option before going to step #2.
2. Open Brave.
3. Select some text in the welcome page.  Or some text inside the body of any web page. This is important.  Everything works within the address bar.  The problem only occurs within the body of the browser window.
4. Hold ⌘ and press X.
Actual result:
What this does is quit Brave as if ⌘Q had been pressed because Brave is somehow blocking or ignoring the reset to the QWERTY layout that this keyboard layout is supposed to enable when ⌘ is held down.
Expected result:
The last step should be the command to cut text (try it in a different program, like Word, Notepad, Chrome, etc.) and since nothing is selected it should do nothing (or cut/copy text if you had selected some).
