Using readProp on ___OUTERS___ opens security hole


Original issue 77 created by ihab.awad on 2008-03-03T00:13:51.000Z:
Please review and comment on the following behavior:
When Caja code in the global scope makes a reference to 'this' --
this.x;
this.x_;
we translate that to references to _OUTERS_ using 'readProp', precisely
as though the synthetic global scope is the 'this object' of the global
code, e.g. --
_OUTERS.x_canRead__ ?
_OUTERS_.x :
.readProp(___OUTERS, 'x');
