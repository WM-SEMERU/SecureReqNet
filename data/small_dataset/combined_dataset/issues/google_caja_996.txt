Refactor rendering pipeline to always pass tokens *and* marks


Original issue 996 created by ihab.awad on 2009-02-25T19:18:05.000Z:
Refactor rendering pipeline so that it always passes consume() and mark() events in a
heterogeneous stream until the last possible step. Concretely this means --

Spacer and Indenter, as currently used from JsPrettyPrinter, accept and return a mixed list of
tokens and positions.
All rendering pipelines end with some form of Concatenator.
The SourceSpansRenderer and SourceSnippetRenderer no longer need to communicate position
information across a delegate renderer by inserting "/@n/" comments, since this information
would be preserved.
Whatever remains of the SourceSpansRenderer would be a "last step" Concatenator that collects
position information, concatenates to text, and builds the debug maps indexing into the
concatenated text.
