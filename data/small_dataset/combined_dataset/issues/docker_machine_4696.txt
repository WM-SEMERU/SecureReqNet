[Hyperv] Docker machine does not change default password from "tcuser"


I've been playing around with docker machine I've noticed that when you provision a machine on hyperv it will generate ssh keys but it does not disable password login or change the password of the docker user leaving it wide open.
Steps to reproduce.
docker-machine create -d hyperv test
docker-machine ip test
ssh docker@192.168.10.xx
Then you can login in with the password "tcuser" and sudo to your hearts content
