kubeadm init did not install '/root/.kube/plugins/verify/verify.sh', after kubeadm reset.


Hello, I met a problem with kubeadm init after kubeadm reset, the CLI kubectl get pods return error: -bash: /root/.kube/plugins/verify/verify.sh: No such file or directory
Reproduce the error:

Use kubeadm (Major:"1", Minor:"13", GitVersion:"v1.13.4") to setup a kubernetes env.
Delete all deployments, and run kubeadm reset.
Follow the log of kubeadm reset and clean the iptables.
Restart vm
after the vm booted, Ran kubeadm init again
Follow the log of kubeadm init and mkdir .kube and cp the config to the dir
Run CLI kubectl get pods
-bash: /root/.kube/plugins/verify/verify.sh: No such file or directory

I checked the .kube directory, there is no verify.sh. the log only tells to cp config, so why the CLI complains about verify.sh? what is verify.sh? or did I do something wrong?
