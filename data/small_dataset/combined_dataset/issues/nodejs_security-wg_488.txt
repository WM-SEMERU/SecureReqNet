What security guidance would be most useful for Node.js developers?


Background
Currently the Guides section of the Node.js documentation does not have any documentation around security. I think it's fair to say that such guidance would be a useful and welcome addition to the documentation.
Based on my experience there are two target groups for such guidance: programmers working on Node.js applications and application security engineers supporting Node.js applications. I think the focus here should be on the first group.
The second group already has a very useful resource in the form of Node.js Security Roadmap. See #101 for background on this document.
This issue was inspired by #478.
Expected outcome
I would like to use this issue to solicit input both from the Security Working Group as well as from the broader Node.js community. An ideal outcome would be a list of security aspects to take into account when writing Node.js programs that we could turn into guides or a set of guides on the Node.js website.
Scope
Ideally, the guidance should be limited to the JavaScript programming techniques, the Node.js runtime and its core libraries.
How to move forward
If you have an idea, describe it and post as a comment under this issue. If you like an already existing idea, use üëç to express support. This way we can gauge the demand for guidance on a given aspect.
