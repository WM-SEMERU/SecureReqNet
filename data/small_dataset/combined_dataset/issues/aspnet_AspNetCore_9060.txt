[Components] Better circuit ids



We should use 128 bits of entropy for the ids.
We should data protect the bits and put them in an http only cookie.
We should hash the bits, protect them and use that protected hash as the id for the circuit.
Upon connection/re-connection we should grab the circuitid cookie, we should unprotect it, hash it and compare it to the unprotected bits when starting the circuit.
