Trezor passphrase being saved to password list and offered by auto fill without permission.


Description
Just upgraded to the new version. Turned on strict site isolation. Plug Trezor in and now my passphrase is available via autofill. The Trezor had been added to the saved passwords list. I didn't ok that. I deleted the pass phrase and the Trezor from the saved password list, entered it again into the Trezor and brave saved the passphrase again without asking. I've since shutdown auto fill and password management via brave.
This behavior started after the update. i'd used the Trezor multiple times today without this issue until the update was made.
