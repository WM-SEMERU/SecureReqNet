[TwigBridge] Suggestion: Add HTTP username and password to `absolute_url`


Description
Allow generating URL's containing username and password: http://foo:bar@example.com/
Example
{{ absolute_url(path(...), {username:'foo', password: 'bar'}) }}
This would be useful in cases where the website is (still) hidden behind some basic HTTP auth, e.g. during development or on a staging server.
Should be easy to implement, just add two optional parameters to HttpFoundationExtension::generateAbsoluteUrl()
