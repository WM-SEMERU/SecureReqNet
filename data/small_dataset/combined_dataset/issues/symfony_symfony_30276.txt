While reviewing the changes announced in the "A Week of Symfony #633" post I found that there was room for improvement in the Validation component translations as they were defined earlier in 2012 and were never revisited.
All the translations have been reviewed and some of them were updated with the following improvements:

overall translation message consistency
fix singular expression messages
fix grammatical errors
use albanian form of expression
restore, as lexical gap, the "locale" translation
