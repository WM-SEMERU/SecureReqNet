Trying to address surface synchronization patch


Trying to address brave/browser-laptop#15025
Removing these patches from browser_plugin.cc:

bbf2817
416dc9c

Most of the above patches have already been removed (after single webview) from browser_plugin.cc
Chromium 68 has a few patches related to surface synchronization, such as this:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/98d76dade64f938d939b7930e1de5460b564c2e2%5E%21/
The above Muon patches were to solve brave/browser-laptop#13982
I compiled this change in release mode + ran with 25 tabs (switching tabs with mouse/keyboard). I quit, relaunched, etc. Also turned off tab preview + used debug menu to manually discard tabs and switch back to them. Didn't notice any of the webviews get locked
Not sure if this solves the problem, but this patch might not be needed anymore
