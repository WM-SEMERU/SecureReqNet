If you configure a firewall with switch user with role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY it's impossible to exit the
impersonation because the next line $this->provider->refreshUser($original->getUser()) will fail. It fails because RefreshUser
expects an instance of UserInterface and here it's a string.
Therefore, it does not make sense to refresh an Anonymous Token, right ?
