Bug 1531933 – Use proper image sizes


Testing:

Try some layout variants (recommend: 66-beta-2-complex, basic, dev-test-all).
Ensure no images break (caveat: since there's a CDN and a image processing service middle tier you may see something broken or slow to load if you're the first to hit it...try reloading if that happens!)
