Create IAM user with least privileges


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
amplify configure creates an IAM user with administrative access as noted in the docs:

By default we give administrator access to this IAM user since the CLI needs access to a variety of services for deployments.

This seems to go against the principle of least privilege outlined by the AWS Well-Architected Framework - Security Pillar (July 2018) whitepaper:

Establishing a principle of least privilege ensures that authenticated identities
are only permitted to perform the most minimal set of functions necessary to
fulfill a specific task, while balancing usability and efficiency.

Describe the solution you'd like
An IAM user with least privilege. In the interim, there should be more guidance on what developers could do to lock down privileges (e.g., example policies).
