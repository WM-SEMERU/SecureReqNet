[Security] AbstractAuthenticationListener should dispatch the login failure event instead of invoking onFailure() directly


At the moment it invokes the onFailure directly, but according to the whole idea of kernel event system it should dispatch the AuthenticationEvents::AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE (or some other) event instead.
Then it would be possible to add custom handlers for the authentication events.
Example of event that you cannot handle with the current implementation: CSRF token mismatch.
