This PR adds the integration of the HttpClient component on FrameworkBundle.
By default, two services are provided, one implementing SFC-HttpClient, and another PSR18:


http_client + its autowiring alias for Symfony\Contracts\HttpClient\HttpClientInterface)
This service is automatically set to the best HTTP client available with the configuration given under the framework.http_client key.


psr18.http_client + its autowiring alias for Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface). To make it work, one needs to provide autowiring aliases for ResponseFactoryInterface and StreamFactoryInterface, which are provided by the recipe for nyholm/psr7 (but could be overriden by apps when using something else).


one can also configure the default options, and "scoped" clients. For example:


http_client:
    default_options:
        capath: '...'
    clients:
        github_client:
            default_options:
                base_uri: 'https://api.github.com'
This definition create a github_client service implementing SFC-HttpClient and a psr18.github_client one implementing PSR18, +2 corresponding named autowiring aliases: HttpClientInterface $githubClient,  and ClientInterface $githubClient.
