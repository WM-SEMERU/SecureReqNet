If a user is removed from a project/group, he/she still receives e-mail notifications for confidential issues.

We should automatically unsubscribe them from confidential issues to ensure no data is leaked.

This could be done via subscriptions, e.g., something like:

```ruby
user = User.find_by(username: 'my-user')
issues = user.notes.where(noteable_type: 'Issue').joins('INNER JOIN issues ON notes.noteable_id = issues.id').where('issues.confidential IS true').select("issues.id AS issue_id").map(&:issue_id).uniq

issues.each do |id|
  issue = Issue.find(id)
  issue.unsubscribe(user, issue.project)
end
```
