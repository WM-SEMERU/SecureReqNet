Events API returns raw etcd errors in some cases


The events REST storage object is not using generic.Etcd, and it's not wrapping the returned errors from etcd with the appropriate pkg/api/errors/etcd handles.  As a result, we return raw etcd errors to clients which leaks server information (security) and is also ugly.
