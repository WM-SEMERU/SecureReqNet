tests: Adds agnhost image

What this PR does / why we need it:
The new image is meant to be used for testing purposes, whenever there
are significant differences between Linux and Windows in the way
something is obtained or tested. For example, the DNS suffix list can
be found in /etc/resolv.conf on Linux, but on Windows, such file
does not exist, and one way to obtain the mentioned list would be
through some powershell commands.
The image contains an extendable CLI as the entrypoint, the tests
only having to add the necessary arguments. For the previous example,
passing the dns-suffix argument will print out the comma separated
DNS suffix list, on both Linux and Windows.
The image name means that it should behave the same way on any host,
no matter the host OS.
