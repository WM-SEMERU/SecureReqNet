angular 7.3 routing breaks IE9


üêû bug report
Affected Package
Tested with @angular/cli:7.3.8
Is this a regression?
yes
Description
When starting an ng-project with routing enabled, the starter template is loaded only after opening the WebDevTools, but an unlimited amount of hashtags are added, resulting in a browser-crash. URL-Example: http://<computer.network.local>:4200/#/#/#/#/#/#/#/...
üî¨ Minimal Reproduction
(1a) (if you don't have an IE9 lying around) Download an IE9-Win7 image from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/
(1b) You need to be able to access your host computer, so you might have to set the new VM to "network bridge"
(2) install @angular/cli@7.3.8: npm install -g @angular/cli@7.3.8
(3) start a new project with routing and SASS support: ng new somefolder --defaults --routing
(4) serve the project: cd somefolder; ng server --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check
(5) open the project in IE9 on the VM on http://<computer.network.local>:4200/ --> nothing is shown
(6) Open the WebDevTools via F12 and reload --> starter template is shown, but an unlimited number of hashtags are added (see above) and the browser crashed.
üî• Exception or Error
none, browser just crashed.

Anything else relevant?

affected version: IE9.0.8112.16421
IE10 and IE11 have been tested and do not show this behavior
Behaviour can be reproduced on aot-build as well: ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check --aot
es5BrowserSupport is set to true by default - but behaviour can be reproduced with es5BrowserSupport: false as well (see angular.json). But the first load shows up without having to open the webdevtools then.
