Audit logs


APIserver should generate audit logs of accesses.
Should these be just HTTP server logs, or should they have more structure?
Things to log in a structured audit log:

identity associated with client, from e.g. tokenfile.Tokenfile
time
which apiserver if multiple ones
sourceIP?
which authorization policy matched (e.g. abac.Policy)
request attributes used for authorization (e.g. authorizer.Attributes)
