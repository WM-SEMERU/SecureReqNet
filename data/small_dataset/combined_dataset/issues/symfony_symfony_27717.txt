[DX] A simple way to check if user is logged in and obtain logged in user


Problem
Checking if user is logged in is easy with:
AuthorizationCheckerInterface::isGranted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED');
Unless you get Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException: The token storage contains no authentication token. One possible reason may be that there is no firewall configured for this URL
This was reported in #16878 and reported is instructed to "So inject the token storage and check if token is available in your custom code."
So it becomes:

null === TokenStorageInterface::getToken() ? false : AuthorizationCheckerInterface::isGranted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED');
And it involves two dependencies.
It's not much easier if you want to obtain current user:
if (!$token = TokenStorageInterface->getToken()) {
    return;
}

$user = $token->getUser();
if (!is_object($user)) {
    return;
}

return $user;
And we can see this code on many places:
