Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.1.0


In my static linking scripts, I have found issues with OpenSSL 1.1.0 and Tor's configure scripts, namely that the -lssl and -lcrypto are in the wrong order on some of the gcc calls to check OpenSSL. I opened this ticket but curious what is needed in these scripts to upgrade OpenSSL.
