Script isn't built from source as a build step


Ideally a script should be handling bundling of script but right now it seems like codekit is being used - which looks to be a desktop app. https://codekitapp.com/
Script should be bundled at build time by a script and not committed built.
If it's committed built then no package updates will have any effect and it will look like we have updated versions of dependencies when we don't which is obviously not a situation we want to be in.
