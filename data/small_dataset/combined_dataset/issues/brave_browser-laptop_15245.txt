"No Usable Sandbox" on Linux  (Solved)


When installed on Debian-Stretch as per the current instructions, brave fails with the message No usable sandbox!
The reason is clear when one runs strace brave.  In the output, one finds the line:
access("/usr/lib/brave/chrome-sandbox", F_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

Under Debian Stretch, the solution is:
apt-get install chromium
ln -s ../chromium/chrome-sandbox /usr/lib/brave/chrome-sandbox

After this, brave will successfully start.
Similar issues:


Issue #8950 was closed with the assertion that the kernel needed to be recompiled.  Since the Debian Stretch stock kernel runs both (google-)chrome and chromium successfully, this appears not to be the case here.


Issue #6902 was closed with the claim that the problem would be solved in some future brave release at some future unspecified date.  That will be good when it happens but the solution/workaround here works right now.


Issues #11175, #9955, #6930, and #7146 are related.
