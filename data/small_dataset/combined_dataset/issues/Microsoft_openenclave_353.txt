Maintainers can build Open Enclave using Clang compiler and extensions on Linux


This addresses user suggestion #79. The immediate benefit is to enables maintainers to use the richer set of static analysis tools developed for clang not available to gcc:

The highest priority is to enable use of the Speculative Load Hardening prototype extension to mitigate Spectre 1 vulnerabilities in the enclave runtime (https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-March/122085.html)
Clang also more static analysis tools around code quality and argument handling which we can enable by default.
MSR has active research and prototypes for new static analysis tools for maintaining enclave safety which they can start refining given direct clang support.

The story requires addressing the following items:

 #276 Refactor enclave libraries to remove dependencies on compiler-specific __builtin functions
 #277 Refactor enclave libraries to remove #pragma GCC dependencies
 #284 OE_StackAlloc creates stack corruption when compiled under clang
 #346 Clang does not support compiling to NOTE sections used for enclave properties
