When LDAP users login for the first time, they are given a default primary email 'username'@'domain'. They cannot change this primary email, so they add secondary emails instead. 

On the Admin interface, Users secondary email are not shown. When an Admin user tries to change a regular user's primary email to an email that was already listed as a secondary email, the Admin User gets an 'Email has already been taken' error.

In the Admin user interface, it would be helpful to see the primary and secondary emails of Users.
