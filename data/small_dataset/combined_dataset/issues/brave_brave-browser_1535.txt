HTTPS Everywhere not working on all sites


Description
The built-in HTTPS Everywhere doesn't seem to work for all sites.
Steps to Reproduce

Visit http://www.speedtest.net
See that it is not secure and did not redirect to https automatically.

Actual result:
Visiting http://www.speedtest.net should have resulted in an https request.
Expected result:
Visiting http://www.speedtest.net did not result in an https request.
Reproduces how often:
100% for speedtest.net. I don't know what all other sites can reproduce.
