# The Problem

Currently when viewing linked social accounts on a gitlab CE user profile page (ex: https://gitlab.com/profile/account ) the only feedback provided to the user is which account is linked in the form of an extra border around the icon. For example in this screenshot, the github service has been linked:

As a user with potentially many google, github, etc. accounts this is not nearly enough information. I would like to be able to see which google account I've linked, and be able to unlink it when necessary (see issue #477)


# Suggestion

Instead of only showing three icons with an outline, display omniauth services in a table, where each service has its own row. Once linked, a service row should display information such as:

* The account username
* The account avatar  
* An 'Unlink <Service> Account' Button (see issue #477)
