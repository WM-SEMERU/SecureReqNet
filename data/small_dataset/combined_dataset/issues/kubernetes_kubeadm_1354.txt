BUG REPORT
Versions
kubeadm version (use kubeadm version): v1.13.2
Environment:

Kubernetes version (use kubectl version): v1.13.2
Cloud provider or hardware configuration: N/A
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): N/A
Kernel (e.g. uname -a): N/A
Others: N/A

What happened?
For all other kubeadm init phase certs subcommands, I can set --cert-dir. For kubeadm init phase certs sa, I cannot.
The reasoning for this (I assume) is that the sa command does not actually relate to certificates - just a public/private key pair. See the code here.
This used to be possible when these subcommands were still under kubeadm alpha phase certs.
What you expected to happen?
Since I can change the target location for other PKI assets, I should be able to do the same for these assets.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
kubeadm init phase certs sa --cert-dir <anything> should error due to --cert-dir not being a valid flag for the sa subcommand at this time.
Anything else we need to know?
I'm also in favor of renaming --cert-dir to --pki-dir if possible, as that seems more logical given the assets that are generated. We could also name the flag differently for just he sa subcommand, I suppose.
