Special notes for your reviewer:
Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
As of Kubernetes 1.15, the SupportNodePidsLimit feature introduced as alpha in Kubernetes 1.14 is now beta, and the ability to utilize it is enabled by default.  It is no longer necessary to set the feature gate `SupportNodePidsLimit=true`.  In all other respects, this functionality behaves as it did in Kubernetes 1.14.
