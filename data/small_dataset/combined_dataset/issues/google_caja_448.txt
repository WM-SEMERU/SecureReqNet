Consider wrapping Math.random()


Original issue 448 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-10T01:18:58.000Z:
Consider replacing or wrapping Math.random() with a pseudorandom number
generator that you provide that you can be sure is cryptographically
pseudorandom and does not introduce communication channels or a hazard of
unintentional side channels.
David-Sarah suggests that this should be up to the container provider, who
can either whitelist Math.random() or not.
