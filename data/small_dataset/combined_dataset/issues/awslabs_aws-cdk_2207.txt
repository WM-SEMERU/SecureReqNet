fix(servicediscovery): allow to register multiple instances on a service


The methods registerNonIpInstance, registerIpInstance and registerCnameInstance had hard-coded ids, resulting in Error: There is already a Construct with name 'CnameInstance' in Service [Service] errors when trying to register multiple instances on a service.
Added id parameter to the registerXxx methods.
Also added a test with multiple instances registered on the same service.
