Here are the changes for highlights:

## Version 8.2

We've finally got [real tests][test] and [continuous testing on Travis][ci]
thanks to [Jeremy Hull][] and [Chris Eidhof][]. The tests designed to cover
everything: language detection, correct parsing of individual language features
and various special cases. This is a very important change that gives us
confidence in extending language definitions and refactoring library core.

We're going to redesign the old [demo/test suite][demo] into an interactive
demo web app. If you're confident front-end developer or designer and want to
help us with it, drop a comment into [the issue][#542] on GitHub.

Other improvements:

- [Erik Osheim][] heavily reworked Scala definitions making it richer.
- [Lucas Mazza][] fixed Ruby hashes highlighting
- Lisp variants (Lisp, Clojure and Scheme) are unified in regard to naming
  the first symbol in parentheses: it's "keyword" in general case and also
  "built_in" for built-in functions in Clojure and Scheme.
