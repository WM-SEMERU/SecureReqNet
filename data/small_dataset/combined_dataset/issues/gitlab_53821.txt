### Problem to solve

Please read https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/51490 first

At the moment we want to be careful about how we use `Kubeclient::HttpError`. Exposing the contents of the error (i.e. the `response` back to the UI) should be considered un-safe.

### Further details

How can we alert contributors to that it is un-safe to expose the response (response body, etc) to the UI ?

Note in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/22964/diffs we are exposing the HTTP response code, e.g. `302`, or `404` - which should be OK.

### Proposal

1. Document guidelines to avoid SSRF in security doc in gitlab-ce
2. Deprecate usage of `Kubeclient::HttpError` in favour of new sub-class that exposes the error very clearly. Something like:

```
  e.error_code
  e.unsafe_response
```

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

We do not add more usages of `Kubeclient::HttpError` in an unsafe way

(If no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this)
