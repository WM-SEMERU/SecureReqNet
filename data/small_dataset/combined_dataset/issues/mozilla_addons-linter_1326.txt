Fetch npm library hashes to detect libraries more broad


cc @wagnerand and @muffinresearch on this for input.
When I thought about a few things for our post-review process I noticed that the list of libraries we actually can detect is fairly short. Especially in our modern world where people use npm to install dependencies.
So my proposal for a better detection of libraries:
â€¦based on the list of libraries we care about (anuglar, jquery etc...)

Fetch hashes and file-names of packages distributed on npm in addition to our staticly configured names (that usually represent how these libraries are distributed on CDNs)
This should probably happen in dispensary
Make sure BANNED_LIBRARIES is using hashes for detection in addition to file-names too

This should make the detection of #1323 or #1304 much more reliable.
