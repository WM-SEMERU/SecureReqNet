Voter granting access to "the application" ?


Voters docs mention several times about "accessing the application"

A voter is a dedicated class that checks if the user has the rights to be connected to the application
...
VoterInterface::ACCESS_GRANTED: The user is allowed to access the application
...
VoterInterface::ACCESS_DENIED: The user is not allowed to access the application

Are we really talking about "accessing the application" rather than "accessing something"
or maybe I didn't understand well
