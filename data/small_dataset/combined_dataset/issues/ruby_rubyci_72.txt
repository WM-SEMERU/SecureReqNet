[Security] Bump rails from 5.2.1 to 5.2.1.1


Bumps rails from 5.2.1 to 5.2.1.1. This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The Ruby Advisory Database.

Bypass vulnerability in Active Storage
There is a vulnerability in Active Storage. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2018-16477.
Impact
Signed download URLs generated by ActiveStorage for Google Cloud Storage service and Disk service include content-disposition and content-type parameters that an attacker can modify. This can be used to upload specially crafted HTML files and have them served and executed inline. Combined with other techniques such as cookie bombing and specially crafted AppCache manifests, an attacker can gain access to private signed URLs within a specific storage path.
Vulnerable apps are those using either GCS or the Disk service in production. Other storage services such as S3 or Azure aren't affected.
All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately. For those using GCS, it's also recommended to run the following to update existing blobs:
ActiveStorage::Blob.find_each do |blob|
  blob.send :update_service_metadata
end

Patched versions: >=5.2.1.1
Unaffected versions: < 5.2.0

Broken Access Control vulnerability in Active Job
There is a vulnerability in Active Job. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2018-16476.
Impact
Carefully crafted user input can cause Active Job to deserialize it using GlobalId and allow an attacker to have access to information that they should not have.
Vulnerable code will look something like this:
MyJob.perform_later(user_input)

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
Patched versions: >= 4.2.11, < 5.0.0; >= 5.0.7.1, < 5.1.0; >= 5.1.6.1, < 5.2.0; >= 5.2.1.1
Unaffected versions: < 4.2.0
