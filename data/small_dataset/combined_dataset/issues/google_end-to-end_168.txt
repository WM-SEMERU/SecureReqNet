Subkey binding signatures for secret keys are invalid.

I was wondering what the process of revoking keys generated w/ the end-to-end extension was?
I tried importing the pub/priv keys into gpg without success (notice --gen-revoke can't find the priv key because it's named ffffffff).
$ gpg --verbose --allow-secret-key-import --import key.asc
gpg: armor header: Charset: UTF-8
gpg: armor header: Version: End-To-End v0.3.1338
