Consider adding OIDC event to handle identity token validation for hybrid flow


I am trying to handle JWE identity tokens returned from an OpenID Provider. Since OpenIdConnectProtocolValidator is meant for JWS, I must ensure that the token sent for validation is the inner token of the decrypted JWE.
A JWE identity token returned from the authorization endpoint (implicit flow) or token endpoint (authorization code flow) can be handled using the token validated event.
However, when using the hybrid flow and receiving a JWE identity token from both the authorization endpoint and token endpoint (e.g. response type of code id_token), I am not given the opportunity to handle the identity token: https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.3/src/Security/Authentication/OpenIdConnect/src/OpenIdConnectHandler.cs#L614.
My current workaround is to override the protocol validator to handle JWS extraction, however according to this issue, the protocol validator is not the place to do this.
Please consider adding an event that would allow the identity token to be modified in this scenario.
