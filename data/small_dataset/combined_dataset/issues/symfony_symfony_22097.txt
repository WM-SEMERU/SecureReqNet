My auth credentials check action:
	/**
	 * @Route("/login_check", schemes={"https"}, name="user_login_check")
	 * @Method({"POST"})
	 */
	public function loginCheckAction()
	{
		throw new \BadMethodCallException('Firewall should have done stuff, not this action!');
	}
As we can see, I require secure connection to be used. The login form creates a proper url (with https instead of http), but it's not actually required. I can edit the url in form and successfully log in without https.
For https to be actually required, I had to add this to my security.yml config:
security:
    access_control:
        - { path: ^/login_check, requires_channel: https }

To sum up the error: I would assume that route configuration should be enough to require https. It's not. Firewall configuration must be applied as well.
