Pronouncable passwords not random enough?


When using the password generator for pronounceable passwords with 10 chars it occurred to me that, except for uppercase/lowercase, words repeat themselves astonishingly often. Are the generated pws truly random, or are they generated from a fixed seed? Was testing the desktop application.
