Can't Post Note to Pages


My code:
$fb->post("MY_PAGE_ID/notes", [ 
	"subject" => "Subject Notes",
	"message" => "Messages Notes"
], $token_pages);
Then result:
An uncaught Exception was encountered
Message: (#200) This endpoint is deprecated since the required permission publish_actions is deprecated
Filename: vendor/facebook/graph-sdk/src/Facebook/Exceptions/FacebookResponseException.php
How to resolve? or what is best practice for my problem?
Thanks
