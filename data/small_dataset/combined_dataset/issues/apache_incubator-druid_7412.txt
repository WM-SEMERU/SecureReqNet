Fix two issues with Coordinator -> Overlord communication.




ClientCompactQuery needs to recognize the potential for 'intervals'
to be set instead of 'segments'. The lack of this led to a
NullPointerException on DruidCoordinatorSegmentCompactor.java:102.


In two locations (DruidCoordinatorSegmentCompactor,
DruidCoordinatorCleanupPendingSegments) tasks were being retrieved
using waiting/pending/running tasks in the wrong order: by checking
'running' first and then 'pending', tasks could be missed if they
moved from 'pending' to 'running' in between the two calls. Replaced
these methods with calls to 'getActiveTasks', a new method that does
the calls in the right order.
