ledger notification should appear above the tab area

#11625 (comment)

ledger notifications are appearing in the tab area instead of above it. this is not ideal because:

they are browser notifications, not tab-specific notifications. i.e., if you change tabs, the notification still appears.
they can be spoofed by an attacker webpage if they are in the tab area


expected behavior: browser notifications that are not tab-specific should appear above the tab strip, like the update notification for example:
