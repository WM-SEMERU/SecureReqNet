OE_GetReport from host must not accept reportData


OE_GetReport currently accepts reportData which is blindly signed into the report generated by the enclave. We must not allow this as it permits the host to create man-in-the-middle attacks for an enclave attempting to bootstrap a security channel with a challenger using the reportData. The primary use case for OE_GetReport from host is as a convenience for obtaining target information to feed to an enclave for local attestation.
