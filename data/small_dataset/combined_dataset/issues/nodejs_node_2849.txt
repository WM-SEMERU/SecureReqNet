Net api servers bind to all configured network interface IPs by default (insecure)


The HTTP server is bound to IPs on all configured interfaces by default. This can lead to unintentional data leaks.
Changing the default binding address to be localhost and ::1 for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively, increases default security which can be overridden by providing a host address in the parameters.
