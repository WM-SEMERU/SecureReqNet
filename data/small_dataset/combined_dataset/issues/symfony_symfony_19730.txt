Some warnings spout out.


The error_reporting spout out this messages upon usage:
Warning: Illegal offset type in D:\xampp\htdocs\project\vendor\symfony\security-csrf\TokenStorage\NativeSessionTokenStorage.php on line 88

Warning: Illegal offset type in D:\xampp\htdocs\project\vendor\symfony\security-csrf\TokenStorage\NativeSessionTokenStorage.php on line 76

As I check upon the aforementioned lines, they use the same practice of use object property as an array key which is considered a bad practice for some. Fortunately, the usage is not detrimental to the efficiency of the class, yet it is quite annoying.
76 .. $_SESSION[$this->namespace][$tokenId] = (string) $token;
88 .. return isset($_SESSION[$this->namespace][$tokenId]);

Shall you suppress such warnings by appending @ or rework this one?
