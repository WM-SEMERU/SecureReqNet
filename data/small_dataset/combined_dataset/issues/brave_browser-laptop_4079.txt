Window.onbeforeunload not working in Brave


Did you search for similar issues before submitting this one?
No
Describe the issue you encountered:
Create a webpage with the following js :
window.onbeforeunload = function(e) {
  var dialogText = 'Dialog text here';
  e.returnValue = dialogText;
  return dialogText;
};

If you try to navigate you are stuck in the page with no alert or nothing. In FF and Chrome it works ok, giving you an alert according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload
Note that the following code does not work on jsfiddle for some reason it has to be on a regular web page.
Expected behavior:
Brave should show an alert.

Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?):
All
Brave Version:
0.12.1
Steps to reproduce:

Open https://jsfiddle.net/L5grdj3a/
Close the window
You don't get alert as you should.
