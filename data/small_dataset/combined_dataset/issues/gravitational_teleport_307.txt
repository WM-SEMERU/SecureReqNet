Should be able to specify a token timeout for nodes add


Currently if I want to add a new node to teleport, I run the following:
tctl nodes add

This generates a token which is valid for 900 seconds.
If I want to add nodes using configuration management like Puppet, the join might take longer than 900 seconds, which isn't very fun.
With this in mind, can we have an option to set the token validity?
