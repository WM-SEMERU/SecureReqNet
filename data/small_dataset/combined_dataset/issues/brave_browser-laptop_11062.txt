replace momentjs with date-fns


Initially, the plan was to reduce bundle cost given moment is enormous and we only use 2-3 methods from there:


What came to my attention regarding security was an issue created in moment's repo explaining that a given regular expression could be used to parse dates specified as strings being vulnerable to ReDoS. I first saw this in a Medium post from Node Security
This, in fact, didn't remove moment entirely as we still require Joi which has it as a dependency but may be a good starting point.
Fix #11061
Test plan:
This affected bookmarks exporter and ledger.
The general test plan is that you can still export a bookmark (with the same file name as before) and ledger/contribution statement should have their times as usual.
Ledger panel and ledger export util tests should pass too. npm run unittest should cover.
