Broken Link


Describe the problem and steps to reproduce it:
What happened?
I clicked on famous and the best translation add-on (s3translator) link from its site. The Link not works.
What did you expect to happen?
I expect Firefox team to keep add-on alive for us. Without it the web surfacing life become difficult and left users with a force to move on chrome browser.
Anything else we should know?
I don't know what happened about s3translator add-on for Firefox. All I know that is very valuable add-on. It was capable of Translating word with just a click while browsing the webpages, without any huge OCR software. It's not a wise choice to let this add-on go.
