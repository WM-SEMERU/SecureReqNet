CSS capabilities exposed via Caja appear to allow covering content of the embedding page


Original issue 1181 created by maciej on 2010-01-13T19:40:20.000Z:
I found this potential security vulnerability by code inspection, so I'm not sure if it is a real
vulnerability or if I have merely misread the code.
In src/com/google/caja/lang/css/css21-whitelist.json, the CSS properties "position", "top" and
"left" are allowed (in addition to "bottom", "top" and "z-index").
Per css21-defs.json in the same directory, it appears that for the "position" property, the values
"relative", "absolute" and "fixed" are allowed. It seems that this would be sufficient to allow
Cajoled content to be positioned outside of its natural contents, overlapping arbitrary other
content in the embedding page. For example, if the embedding page has a password field,
Cajoled content could cover it with its own and trick users into giving up their passwords.
I have not been able to get Caja running enough to attempt a proper proof-of-concept, so I
don't know if there is a mechanism to prevent this.
