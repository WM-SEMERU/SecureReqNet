[security] make it easier to redefine Alpha/Gamma


While talking about some security aspect and as to how you'd alter Alpha
or Gamma role in a specific environment, I realized that these
module-scoped constants would be much more useful as class attributes.
This way, someone can override these sets in their security manager
to alter base roles.
