Domita dynamic HTML sanitizer does not mangle NAME or CLASS attributes


Original issue 602 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-13T17:51:35.000Z:
In domita.js, rewriteAttribute() does not name-mangle any attribute with
html4.atype.NAME or html4.atype.NMTOKENS (including, e.g., NAME= or CLASS=
attributes).  This means that any gadget can declare itself to have any
name or any class -- including can associate itself with CSS stylesheets of
other gadgets or of the container.  The issues with NAME= have been
documented separately and explored in detail by the team.  The issue with
CLASS= can lead to a communication channel between two gadgets, and might
in some highly obscure cases enable more serious containment breaches (if
the container declares a stylesheet that contains Javascript, and if the
gadget can create a DOM node whose CLASS= attribute points to that
stylesheet, does the Javascript execute in the context of the gadget?).
