Firewall and router execution order & custom exception handling


I'm having a very hard time trying to push Symfony to display custom 404 pages being aware of the current security context. Let me explain what I mean.
Since the release of the 2.1 version the order of firewall and router execution has been altered and now I can't create a custom 404 page which uses security role checking.
It is a very important issue for me (and I think I might not be the only one who considers this being a bug), because I really need security context in that situation. Why? I am writing an app in which I wanted the 404 page to show different content depending on whether the user is authorized or not. Moreover, different roles can alter the content being shown as well.
After many hours of frustration and hopeless tries to pass the exceptions to controllers, registering event subscribers which handle them etc. I have found no way to overcome that problem.
Is there any solution to that? I am not satisfied with the answer "404 error page and security checks do not work together" (see #5320) and "don't use security checks on error pages and you'll be fine" - I think it is a bad design to not allow to use that.
If you have any idea what can be made to fix that I will be happy to contribute code, but honestly I don't know all the motives behind the decision - so I'd like to know why is it done like that, how could I address that issue and if anyone has any idea on how to modify the Symfony code if necessary. If anything in my description is unclear, I can provide a working (or rather - not working) example illustrating that problem, in form of a Symfony standard edition fork or exemplary code.
