Allow a global CIDR list source managed by third party


ISSUE TYPE

Feature Idea (possibly a plugin?)

COMPONENT NAME
possibly VR, API and UI
SUMMARY
Imagine that you have your firewall ACL configuration being dependent upon a third party, that is, they would publish at least one a day a list of networks your users need to reuse across many accounts.
That is, this proposed feature would allow:

introducing a global proxy CIDR source in some standard fashion (URL gives you a JSON) and a refresh rate
referencing the proxy source instead explicit field entry of CIDRs
pull-based automatic propagation/injection of changes to all linked VRs similar to a cron job

Note: from high-level user perspective, they want to use the third party CIDR lists in any context where you might need them.
@rhtyd what do you think?
