Adding a new client ConfitionalHttpClient to the new HttpClient component.
This class is intended to allow different options to be sent based on a regexp executed on the url of the request.  In simple words : Auto-configure the default options based on the requested URL.
This class implement the HttpClientInterface interface
The first regexp that math the url win.
Its first parameter expects an object implementing the HttpClientInterface interface
The second parameter is an array, of default options to use when the regexp provided as key matches the requested URL, to be given to the HttpClientInterface request method.
Here is an example of how to use this class :
$regexpOptions = [
   '#^.*length-broken$#' => [ 'headers' => [
         'ConditionalHttpClient' => 'CurlHttpClient',
         'ConditionalHttpClient2' => 'url:length-broken',
   ]],
   '#^.*$#' => ['headers' => ['ConditionalHttpClient' => 'CurlHttpClient']],
]

$client = new ConditionalHttpClient(new CurlHttpClient(), $regexpOptions );

//Will result in a merge of the second $regexpOptions index value and
//the options given to $client->request()
$client->request('POST', 'http://anydomain/', [
    'headers' => [ 'Content-Type' => 'application/json'],
]);

//Only the first $regexpOptions index value will be use as we do not give
//extra options to the request call
$client->request('GET', 'http://anydomain/length-broken');
