noscript allowing selective sites once doesn't invalidate the exceptions


tested on master

disable scripts globally and go to https://jsfiddle.net/
click noscript icon. unselect all except jsfiddle.net and hit 'allow once'
close tab then open jsfiddle.net again
click noscript icon. it appears jsfiddle.net is still allowed.
