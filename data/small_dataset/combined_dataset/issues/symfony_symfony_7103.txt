[security] Enable a firewall to a specific host (subdomain)


Symfony 2.2 introduces a possibility to point a route to a specific host, or a subdomain.
Now, it should be possible to define a specific host to a firewall. I believe it should be like this:
firewalls:
    manager:
        pattern: ^/.*
        host: manager.domain.com
        ...
