Implement lacking functions in Rust SDK


This implements new functions below in Rust SDK and updates related documents and examples.

SetLabel(key, value)
SetAnnotation(key, value)
GameServer()
WatchGameServer(function(gameserver){â€¦})

I believe this PR make that the Rust SDK have all the SDK functionality.
This PR includes reformatting code by rustfmt.
If it is not acceptable, I would make another one including reformatting code only.
