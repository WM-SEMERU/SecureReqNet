[Console] broken terminal after running tests


On 3.4, 4.2, master:
When I run the tests of the Console component, my terminal ends up being broken.
Running this is enough to reproduce:
./phpunit src/Symfony/Component/Console/ --filter testCommandWithQuestionsButNoInputs
If I revert #30271, the issue is gone.
ping @chalasr if you have any idea why
