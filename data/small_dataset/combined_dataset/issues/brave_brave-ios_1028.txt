Fix #1023: Fix Pinch to Zoom not working correctly on all sites


Fix #1023
This change sets ignoresViewportScaleLimits to true. From the documentation:

Setting this property to TRUE allows the webpage to be scaled, regardless of the author's intent. The ignoresViewportScaleLimits property overrides the user-scalable HTML property in a webpage. Defaults to FALSE.
