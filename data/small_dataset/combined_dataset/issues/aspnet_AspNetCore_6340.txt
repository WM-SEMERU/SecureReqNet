Improve logging/error reporting for External Authentication


As discussed in #6069, errors logged from External Login providers are vague and ambigious:
Correlation failed

The oauth state was missing or invalid.

Neither of those is really helpful to know what's actually sent or not sent to the server; and at which point is the handshake failing. Even with Sentry, which logs the data from the request with the error, at best I have an encrypted token that's completely meaningless to me. I imagine Fiddler is about the same.
It'd be nice to have a log trail for External Login that can be correlated with the error, and more info for the actual error as well.
