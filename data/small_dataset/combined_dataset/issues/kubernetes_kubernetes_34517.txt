Client certificate auth is using the subject CN from the intermediate CA cert, not from the end entity cert


Is this a request for help? (If yes, you should use our troubleshooting guide and community support channels, see http://kubernetes.io/docs/troubleshooting/.):
I tried slack, someone else ran in to my issue as well and just used separate CAs
What keywords did you search in Kubernetes issues before filing this one? (If you have found any duplicates, you should instead reply there.):

Install tools:

Manually generated ssl certs
Others:
I'm using client-cert+ABAC auth and have audit logging enabled.

What happened:
Clients using SSL certs for auth show the subject CN of their intermediate cert not their entity cert.
I set the client-cert to a certificate chain:



ca.pem on all machines is set to the Root Cert
What you expected to happen:
I expect the client to use the Subject CN of the entity cert.
The key I'm using is for the entity and the connection is secure, My audit logs just show the CN for the intermediate CA.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Create a root CA cert
Use it to sign an intermediate CA cert.
Use root cert as CA, use certificate chain bundle as client cert, use correct client key
I'm seeing this in audit logs when I use the chain:
2016-10-10T23:04:07.466636575Z AUDIT: id="79f6295c-d229-488b-af12-67cca35e6eee" ip="10.0.0.12" method="GET" user="PeriscopeData Key1 Sub-CA" as="" namespace="" uri="/api/v1/nodes?fieldSelector=metadata.name%3Dip-10-0-0-12.ec2.internal&resourceVersion=0"
When I set the ca.pem to my sub-ca key and don't use my bundled certs, I see
