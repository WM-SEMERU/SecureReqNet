Unable to see the python stack trace for HTTP 500


Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!

 I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
 I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
 I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.

Superset version
0.28.1
Expected results
python stack trace in console
Actual results
No stack trace but just INFO
Steps to reproduce
I want to debug an issue but I'm not able to see anything in the console. Its just printing INFO messages.
This is the error I get:
Sql lab > select schema > select table
Error occurred while fetching table metadata
The following is there in config.py but I cannot see any trace!
SHOW_STACKTRACE = True
