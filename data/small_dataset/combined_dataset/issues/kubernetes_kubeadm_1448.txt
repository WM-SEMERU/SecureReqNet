KubernetesVersionToImageTag: consider using dash instead of underscore for disallowed characters


Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?
FEATURE REQUEST
Versions
master - commit 517922f
What happened?
Let's say we have a git tag for Kubernetes that includes semver build metadata (delineated using a +), such as v1.13.4+abc.123. There is code in kubeadm that takes the version and translates it to a string that is a valid image tag. Characters such as + are disallowed, and the code translates all disallowed characters to underscores (_). The expected tag is therefore v1.13.4_abc.123.
What you expected to happen?
This is 100% valid, but personally I think dash (-) is nicer looking than underscore (_).
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?

Create a git tag that has a + in it, as in the example above.
Build kubeadm
Use kubeadm init with a configuration that specifies the git tag as the kubernetes version
Check the static manifests - all the kubernetes images will have tags with a _ where the tag has a +

Anything else we need to know?
