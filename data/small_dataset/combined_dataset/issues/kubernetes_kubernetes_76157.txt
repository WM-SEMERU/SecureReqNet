Call Done only on sync'ed key


What type of PR is this?
/kind bug
What this PR does / why we need it:
Currently ssc.queue.Done(key) is called at the end of processNextWorkItem().
However, if the sync() fails, we call ssc.queue.AddRateLimited on the key.
In this case, the Done() should not be called.
NONE
