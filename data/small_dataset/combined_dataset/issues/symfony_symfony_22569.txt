In #22034, I wondered myself if we shouldn't throw a dedicated exception to handle bad formatted requests and give more inputs to the client by returning a 400 response with an explicit message.
Here is a suggestion, introducing a new BadRequestFormatException and using it in UsernamePasswordJsonAuthenticationListener whenever there is no custom failure handler set (but someone using its own handler should be able to treat the failure properly too).
As discussed with @chalasr , it seems better to directly throw a BadRequestHttpException as it's actually out of the whole security process. PR updated.
