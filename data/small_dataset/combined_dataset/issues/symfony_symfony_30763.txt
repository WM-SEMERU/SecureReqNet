[FrameworkBundle] Framework services decorated with FQCN are not used in components


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.1.4 although newest FrameworkBundle seems to do the same
Description
In our app tests we have decorated the event dispatcher:
App\Tests\EventSubscriber\EventDispatcherSpy:
        decorates: Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface

And it works well for our services where we depend on the EventDispatcherInterface - decorated instance of the service is injected correctly. Today it turned out that decorated service is not passed to framework-constructed services though. For instance workflows due to injection of event_dispatcher service are getting original instance of the EventDispatcher, not the decorated one.
Since I've found nothing special about decorating framework services in the Service decoration docs I wanted to ask: what is the correct way of decorating services so they are used everywhere? Should we decorate event_dispatcher instead of Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface? Or should decorating an alias decorate the aliased service, not the alias itself?
Possible Solution
Use FQCNs as service ids in FrameworkBundle or fix decorating aliases.
