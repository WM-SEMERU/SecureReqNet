Feature request: ASP.NET Core oauth authentication code to support authentication using oauth access token without requiring to redirect the user to oauth login page.


Could not find information in the documentation for the following question: If our client side code authenticates the user and gets the user access token from facebook, and then we send it using ajax to server, how can we authenticate the user on server side using the net core facebook oauth handler in this situation (https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/src/Security/Authentication/Facebook/src/FacebookHandler.cs)?
Meaning that if we have already the user access token, how can this be integrated into the usual oauth flow seamlessly without redirecting the user anywhere?
Same scenario can be required if we have the user access token saved in the database and we want to login the user automatically after verifying the token and prevent the user needing to login again.
The documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/facebook-logins?view=aspnetcore-2.2) only addresses the scenario where the user gets redirected and I dont see explanation about how to perform the oauth flow when using ajax
Should we call directly FacebookHandler.CreateTicketAsync method?
What lead to this question:
We use the net core facebook authentication middleware as usual and it works when using using full redirect and not ajax.
We also use it in our cordova app.
We received from facebook a Policy Warning:

Platform Policy 8.2: Native iOS and Android apps that implement Facebook Login must use our official SDKs for Login

and after responding to them that we use this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/facebook-logins?view=aspnetcore-2.2
We received an answer:

Looking through the tutorial link provided, it is showing our unofficial SDK login method.
Our official SDK do not require users to enter FB username and password, instead, it will immediately redirect user to Facebook authentication requests page and clicking continue as [test user] will log user in.

So to achieve this we try to integrate with https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4 plugin which authenticates the user on the client side and gets the user access token from facebook. Then we send it to the server and now we want this to seamlessly blend into the usual net core oauth flow.
