[Login] Why it's necessary to have a phpsessid to login?


We're in a scenario where there is  a login form created by Sencha, that sends username and password directly to login_check. We created an own Listener to bypass the csrf protection. The first time you do login, the AbstractAuthenticationListener throws an exception:
            if (!$request->hasPreviousSession()) {
                throw new SessionUnavailableException('Your session has timed-out, or you have disabled cookies.');
            }

Wich will be the best approach to resolve this?
