Makes Finder::in() throw a DirectoryNotFoundException instead of an InvalidArgumentException if one of the directories is not found.
This behavior is more consistent with the AccessDeniedException for files which are unreadable due to insufficient permissions.
To keep backward compatibility, the new exception class inherits from InvalidArgumentException.
[1] A valid, but non-existent directory name is IMHO not an invalid argument
[2] However, it may be semantically better to extend from RuntimeException,  This would require a deprecation.
[3] Possible exceptions are currently not explained at https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/finder.html
