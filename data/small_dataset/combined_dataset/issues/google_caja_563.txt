Domita doesn't always validate the types of values it returns from DOM objects


Original issue 563 created by davidsarah.hopwood on 2008-06-12T23:08:48.000Z:
For example consider
TameImageElement.prototype.getSrc = function () {
return this.node___.src;
};
The .src property should be a string, but we are depending on the browser
not to return some wierd object that looks like a string but that might
grant extra authority. Coercing to a string (or whatever other type) would
be safer.
