Shaded Guava 20.0 dependency vulnerable to CVE-2018-10237


Expected behavior
Bundled (shaded) dependencies should not have any known security defects.  Specifically, the shaded Guava library should be at least version 24.1.1 or 25.0, or newer.
Actual behavior
Guava 11.0 through 24.1 (inclusive) contain two classes that, if exploited via Java and/or GWT Serialization, can lead to unbounded memory allocation.  This vulnerability is covered by CVE-2018-10237.
The master branch of ApplicationInsights Java library still depends on Guava 20.0 and shades within the published applicationinsights-core JAR.  (I have not checked other JARs from this library.)  This version of Guava has been included since at least version 2.1.2 of this library, and likely earlier versions.
