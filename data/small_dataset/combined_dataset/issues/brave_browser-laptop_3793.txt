whitelisted mixed content pages incorrectly showing as secure in private browsing mode


to repro:

go to https://mixed-script.badssl.com/ in a regular browsing session and allow mixed content
open a private tab and go to the same URL

expected behavior:
the private tab shows the unlocked icon
actual behavior:
the private tab shows the locked icon even though insecure scripts are loaded
