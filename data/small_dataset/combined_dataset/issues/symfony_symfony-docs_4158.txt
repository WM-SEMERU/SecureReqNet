[DX] Fix the documentation about the Symfony security


If you read this DX issue regarding the security roles, you can read one of the usual awesome replies by @stof: symfony/symfony#11728 (comment)
You'll see that the Security chapter and cookbooks need some serious improvements. Given that we are talking about Security, I think that this should be a high priority issue.
For now, this is the roadmap of changes to make:

 Never mention that IS_AUTHENTICATED_* are roles. They are not.
 Better explain the differences between roles, strings, expressions, ACL permissions maps, etc.
