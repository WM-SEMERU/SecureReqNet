This PR proposes adding the toString() method to the \Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Role\Role class. This should ease the comparison of role strings and instances of Role itself. For example, in the FOSUserBundle the User model contains roles which are represented as strings. This makes comparisons between arrays of Role objects and role strings difficult without creating your own Role class with a __toString(),  and this isn't always desirable.
I found some conversation around adding the \Seriazable interface to the Role class, and I realise that this might also be considered a BC break if people are relying on the fact that it will not cast to a string.
