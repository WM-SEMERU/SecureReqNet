Network Error


Hello,
I'm having Network Error on my self-host KeeWeb:

That are the network information showed in Chrome:


I'm try to open my password DB using WebDav protocol but i have found this issues.
I have downloaded the windows client and i was able to open my password DB from WebDav.
I have tried to open the DB from my WebDav server( is a SME one (storage made easy server)) using your public KeeWeb UI but i get the same issues.
But as i said with windows client all works fine.
It look like CORS is enable on my SME server this is the basic test that i do:
[root@keeweb ~]# curl --user 'user:password' --head https://webdav.it/Database/pwd.kdbx HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 26 Mar 2019 07:56:47 GMT Server: Apache Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000 Vary: Authorization Last-Modified: Mon, 25 Mar 2019 16:30:59 GMT ETag: "3dd252827dea41b3198d47ad48097c3a" Content-Type: application/octet-stream 
That are the log showed from KeeWeb UI about WebDav connection:
[DEBUG] 2019-03-26T07:51:45.538Z [storage-webdav] Stat https://pws.kdbx [DEBUG] 2019-03-26T07:51:46.164Z [storage-webdav] Stat error https://pwd.kdbx 626ms
Could Someone help me with that ?
Thank you in advanced,
Best Regards,
Davide.
