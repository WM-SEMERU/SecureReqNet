WIP: Speed up rolling-update - longer timeout on validation, less scheduled holds


We reduce the amount of time we wait on a purely scheduled basis
during a rolling-update, and instead increase the timeout on the
validation.
This will be a behavioural change - particularly for --cloudonly
mode, but that mode seems more useful when things are going wrong
anyway, when people will likely set even lower timeouts.
