Migrate the web console back to Blueprint v3


The saga concludes! ðŸŽ†
First the web console was written in BP3 then it was discovered that the license on BP3 was non-standard so we hastily migrated the console to use BP1.0.1 which had a vanilla Apache 2.0 license. Now Palantir and the Blueprint team has agreed to change the license back to vanilla Apache 2.0.
This PR upgrades Blueprint to version 3.15.0 (or above) which is Apache 2.0 licensed.
This PR effectively undoes the work in #7139
Result: the web console is a little more beautiful and a lot less hacky with easy to find current docs for its code UI framework.
