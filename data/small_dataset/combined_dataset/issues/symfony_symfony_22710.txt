It's pretty common when developing a Single Page Application to use a fragment hash for routing on the javascript side. It's also common that a user may bookmark a specific page that contains a hash that describes how to get back to wherever they were. If you have your site behind a Symfony login page then the hash of the URL is lost when they have to log back in.
To fix this I think the following new security bundle options are needed for the form_login:

fragment_path_parameter: defaults to _fragment_path. This user is responsible for storing the hash in this parameter during the login process.
use_fragment_path: Default to false. This controls whether or not the redirect would attempt to use the contents of the fragment path on the redirect.

I don't mind working on something like this. Just curious if this seems like an OK approach before I start.
