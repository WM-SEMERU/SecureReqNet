Blazor: Add a possiblity to pass data from page component to main index.cshtml during prerendering


Problem to solve
We want to use Blazor app as normal web app which has to be SEO friendly. We also want to integrate this app with social sites. To achieve this we have to dynamically build <head> section of html page. We have to have different title, description and metatags for each page.
Describe the solution you'd like
We have prerendering already and main index.html file is now index.cshtml (at least in Blazor server side). One thing is missing. I would like to have some data structure (I want to define it myself) which is accessible to this main index.cshtml file and to all page files. You should make some magic and run prerendering logic first and then render the main index.cshtml file. With this functionality in place each page will be able to assign required information to fields in the data structure and then main html output will be correctly generated by index.cshtml.
This is critical if we want to have proper SEO and integration with social sites.
