Support redis via unix socket


Currently the redis cache support is hard-coded to use TCP as transport mechanism. Please also support unix sockets for connection to redis.
Relevant code is in registry/handlers/app.go:
conn, err := redis.DialTimeout("tcp",
    configuration.Redis.Addr,
    configuration.Redis.DialTimeout,
    configuration.Redis.ReadTimeout,
    configuration.Redis.WriteTimeout)
