If in Safari Browser the feature "Preload Top Hit in the background" is enabled, the LogicException 'You are already switched to %s user.' will be thrown upon entering a ?_switch_user URL with another username than the one suggested by Safari. This issue can be reproduced in Safari with the feature enabled after opening a few user-switch URLs.
I am honestly not sure if this is an issue which should be fixed in any way other than disabling the feature in the browser, but I wanted to note it here in case anyone is confronted with the same problem. As a fix on Symfony side, I could only imagine allowing to switch user when impersonated (why not?) or finding a hacky way to either detect if the site is being preloaded (redirect via HTML/JavaScript to the "real"-switching-site) or disabling the preload (link rel no preload). I do not consider the latter two realistic respectively sensible and am aware that the first one was already discussed.
Anyway, don't hesitate to close the issue as-is, but I hope someone one day might be thankful for my discovery.
