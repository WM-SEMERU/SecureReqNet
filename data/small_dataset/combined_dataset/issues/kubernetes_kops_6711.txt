4. What commands did you run?  What is the simplest way to reproduce this issue?

Output:
E0401 15:36:25.566480       1 reflector.go:304] github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cluster-proportional-autoscaler/pkg/autoscaler/k8sclient/k8sclient.go:92: Failed to watch *v1.Node: unknown (get nodes)

I am rather new to the k8s internals, so I don't know what effect this has on the cluster. I noticed that the kube-dns team fixed this back in July 2018.
However, it seems that the manifest in kops hasn't been updated in a while.
Seems like a fairly straightforward bugfix to me, but I assume someone would perhaps like to correct this by updating the entire manifest instead of just adding "watch" to the allowed verbs. I could send a PR if you like though :-)
