Use pvc uid in endpoint/service label


If the pvc name is more than 63 chars, the endpoint creation
will fail due to the validation of objectmeta length of fields ie 63 chars at max.
This patch introduce an enhancement where if the pvc name is >=63 the pvc uid
is recorded at label instead of name. To preserve backward compatibility, the pvcname
has been kept in endpoint metadata label if length of pvc name is <63chars.
