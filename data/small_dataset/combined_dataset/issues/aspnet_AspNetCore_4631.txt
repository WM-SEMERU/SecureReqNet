InvalidOperationException: Cannot resolve scoped service 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.ITicketStore' from root provider.


Is it possible to resolve a scoped service for use with ITicketStore? For example, if I want to use a DbContext to load the ticket data upon renew.
If not, does that mean I need a singleton DbContext?
