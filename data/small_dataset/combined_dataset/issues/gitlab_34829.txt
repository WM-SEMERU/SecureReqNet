'### Description

Admin users *should* be trusted, but sometimes the trust is misplaced.

We encountered a situation with admin users impersonating other users to perform tasks instead of asking those other users to perform them. In one case, this resulted in a broken build, and downstream builds breaking as well. Until it was clear what happened, the developer whose name was attached to the build was on the hook. This wasn't fair.

### Proposal

The proposal has two parts
- When an admin impersonates a user, that user is sent an alert e-mail to say this.
- For further hardening, the impersonating should not be permitted until the user has granted permission, which would be on a case-by-case basis.

The former should be default behaviour that can't be turned off. The latter could be configurable. Also, the latter could be default behaviour to allow an admin impersonate a user that uses DFA, integrating the process into the DFA implementation.

There are proposals (see below) to provide additional logging when an admin impersonates a user. This is an additional proposal, not an alternative.

The value here is that while logging can document the actions taken by an admin while impersonating another user, reviewing the log will not help recover from a destructive action, such as deleting a group.

Alerting the user that an admin has started impersonating them has two general benefits:
- It allows the user to know that someone else is performing actions on their behalf and they have the option of ignoring, accepting and monitoring, or objecting and reporting.
- Admins now know that their actions will be immediately known, and they will behave accordingly. i.e. they will be less likely to impersonate without good reason.
