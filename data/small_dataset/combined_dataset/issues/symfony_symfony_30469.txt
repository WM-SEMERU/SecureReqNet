Added hyperlink to definition of interfaces/classes that can be used for autowiring.
But I need help with:


the aliases are becoming hyperlinks too, but shouldn't.
It's outputting <fg=yellow;href=phpstorm://open?file=filepath&line=17>Symfony\Contracts\Translation\TranslatorInterface</> <fg=cyan>(translator.default)</>


it currently works with phpstorm because it's hardcoded but it should work with framework.ide option, but don't know what the best approach is to support that config option.
