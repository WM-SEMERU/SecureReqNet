WIP: Create a new PartialObjectMetadata focused client and switch GC to use it


As part of kubernetes/enhancements#929, we want to use PartialObjectMetadata from at least one client internally.
Create a new variant of the dynamic client (still WIP for code structure) that works with PartialObjectMetadata and use it in the garbage collector.
/kind feature
TODO:

 Clean up the client and potentially move it to a new package k8s.io/client-go/metaclient or similar
 Add better client docs for the package
 Measure performance change to GC controller to validate
 Complete integration test for client

Introduce a new client that can deal with Kubernetes API objects generically by reading only their metadata and use it in the garbage collection controller to both simplify code and improve the performance of garbage collection.
