Basic auth extension


This PR adds an extension that provides implementations of the auth interfaces introduced in #4271 :

an Authenticator which supports HTTP Basic authentication
an Escalator which supports HTTP Basic authentication
an Authorizer which implements basic role-based access control

With the large amount of changes (almost a rewrite) from the last round of PR reviews on #4823, I felt like it would be easier to close the old PR and start a fresh one.
Some design notes:

The user/role information is stored in the metadata store, using the "druid_config" table as a key-value store, user/role maps are stored as serialized byte arrays
On the coordinator a *MetadataStorageUpdater class is responsible for handling writes to the user/role DB and holds a deserialized cached copy of the latest DB state
Each node has a *CacheManager instance that polls the coordinator for the latest DB state periodically, this also syncs the auth DB state at startup time
The coordinator can also notify and push updates to remote nodes, using the *CacheNotifier classes
The BasicHTTPAuthenticator and BasicRoleBasedAuthorizer perform their checks using cached info from the *CacheManager instance, to avoid overloading the coordinator
The coordinator nodes have a jersey resource for configuring the auth DB, which also holds the endpoint that nodes poll to get the latest DB state
A jersey resource is also installed on non-coordinator nodes, containing an endpoint that listens for DB state updates
