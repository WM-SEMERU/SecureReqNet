[WIP] Fix #195  Added Migration code for sqlite files from Document to Application Support folder


Sqlite file is now migrated to the new folder. There two questions that need to be answered/invetigated before merge.

How will this function when there is data model version change(ie DB migration).
Before we allow iTunesFileSharing, we need to make sure all contents of Documents Directory are allowed for user visibility.
Fore Example: https-everywhere-data folder and Locally saved cookies(can be moved to Application support).
