kops cannot locate s3 bucket [us-east-2]


1. What kops version are you running? The command kops version, will display
this information.
Version 1.11.1 (git-0f2aa8d30)
2. What Kubernetes version are you running? kubectl version will print the
version if a cluster is running or provide the Kubernetes version specified as
a kops flag.
Client: 1.13.4
Server not currently running
3. What cloud provider are you using?
AWS
4. What commands did you run?  What is the simplest way to reproduce this issue?
kops edit ig nodes -v 10
5. What happened after the commands executed?
an error message that says that kops is unable to list AWS regions
6. What did you expect to happen?
I expected that I would be able to edit the number of instances in my IG
7. Please provide your cluster manifest. Execute
kops get --name my.example.com -o yaml to display your cluster manifest.
You may want to remove your cluster name and other sensitive information.
Unfortunately, kops cannot access the s3 bucket (I get the same error).
8. Please run the commands with most verbose logging by adding the -v 10 flag.
Paste the logs into this report, or in a gist and provide the gist link here.

9. Anything else do we need to know?

My KOPS_STATE_STORE is located in AWS region us-east-2
I have been learning kubernetes and have been completely shutting down the cluster at night by editing the number of instances in each IG to 0.
Running commands from ubuntu on windows and kops has worked perfectly for the past month.
Here is the output from the command

root@DESKTOP:~/.kube# kops edit ig nodes -v 10
