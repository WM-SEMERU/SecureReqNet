Bundled minimatch is deprecated for ReDOS vuln


I'm opening this issue because:

What's going wrong?
See npm/fstream-ignore#14  Posting here so that I can reference the actual source of the issue.
While minimatch 3.0.2 satisfies all deps in the npm dep tree, npm is shipping with minimatch 3.0.0 which has been deprecated.
This is a deployment rather than behavior issue.  I believe @othiym23 may already have done something to fix/investigate it, but it's a bit tricky because npm@2 has to be used to create the bundle or else npm@2 can't install it properly or something?  (I'm probably getting this at least partly if not mostly wrong, sorry.)
How can the CLI team reproduce the problem?
Run npm ls in the npm codebase.  Observe that minimatch@3.0.0 exists in the tree.
supporting information:

npm -v prints: 3.10.6
