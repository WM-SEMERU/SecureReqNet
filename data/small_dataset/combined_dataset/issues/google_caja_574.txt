Don't bless result of getInnerHtml()


Original issue 574 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-13T00:08:38.000Z:
Domita must not bless the result of getInnerHtml().  It's tempting to bless
its output so that you can call setInnerHtml() on that without validating
it.  Don't do that.  It introduces crazy vulnerabilities: it'll copy script
from one gadget to another (which means that the plugin_event_dispatcher
will refer to the wrong gadget), and it may copy mangled named.
