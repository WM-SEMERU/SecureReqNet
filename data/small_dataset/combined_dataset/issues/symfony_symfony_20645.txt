[Security] Integration with form for login


Hello,
I was wondering if it could be interesting to provide a intergration between the security and form components for the login part.
The security listeners for login work with the request object directly. It's easy to create a formType class and use it to display the form, but it will never be submitted.
I see two main benefits of using a formType for the login:

templating: use the same markup as in other form without writing all the html, with the form_* twig functions
validation: ease validation of the scalar values of the fields (without security considerations) like an email format

Do you think it is worth working on it ? If so where should it live ? Any other recommandations ?
Thank you
