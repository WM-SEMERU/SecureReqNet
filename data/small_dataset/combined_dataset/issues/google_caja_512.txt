Need a global configuration flag for "enable insecure mode"


Original issue 512 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-11T21:30:26.000Z:
Right now there are some uncounted number of configuration flags/settings
that if set causes Caja to be insecure in subtle ways.  (e.g., set
embeddable mode to false, enable non 7-bit-printable-ASCII output, enable
debug mode).  There should be a master
I_really_want_to_be_horribly_insecure flag.  If this flag is not set, and
any of the other "shoot yourself in the foot in a subtle way" flags is set,
then the Cajoler should error out, report a configuration error, and refuse
to Cajole its input.
