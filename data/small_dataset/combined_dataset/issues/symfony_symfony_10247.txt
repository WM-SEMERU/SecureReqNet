[Security] introduce target_forward: true option to prevent redirect on success login


There are nice failure_forward: false and use_forward: false options that allow me exactly what I want - to have forwards instead of redirects. But I also want to have something like target_forward or success_forward option that will allow me to use forward instead of redirect.
Its convenient to have redirect after login on the site, but when you send an ajax request probably you don't want a redirect, but just want to have a success respond.
Does anyone think that we need it? If so I can help to implement it.
