Issuer validation problem


Hello!
Azure AD B2C produces JWT with issuer "https://sts.windows.net/{TENANT_ID}/', however JwtBearerHandler takes issuer from Open ID metadata endpoint (https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration), as I see, which is "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}/v2.0".
Is there a way to override thsi behavior? Add some custom issuer validatior or add "sts.windows.net" to the list of valid issuers?
I see that inside AzureADB2CAuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddAzureADB2CBearer JwtBearerOptionsConfiguration is used. Is it possible to add some injection point or extend AzureADB2COptions to add valid issuers to the list?
Thank you!
