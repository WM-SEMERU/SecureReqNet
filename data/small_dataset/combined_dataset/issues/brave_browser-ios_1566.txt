keychain items are exposed to icloud backups


from https://www.securetheorem.com/app/1/issues/006613:
The following items stored by the App in the Keychain are exported to backups:
sqlcipher.key.logins.db
pinLockInfo

Having sensitive data sent to iCloud exposes it to both Apple, Inc. and an attacker with the ability to compromise the user's iCloud account

Recommendation:
In order prevent Keychain data from being migrated to iTunes and iCloud backups, explicitly set a ThisDeviceOnly accessibility class (such as kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly) for all Keychain items. More information about such accessibility classes is available at https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/security/Reference/keychainservices/Reference/reference.html.
Additionally, because the official iOS Keychain APIs (including SecItemAdd() and SecItemCopyMatching()) are overly complex and difficult to use, consider leveraging a wrapper instead in order to simplify the process of storing and retrieving data from the Keychain.
The Valet open source library can be used for this purpose: https://github.com/square/Valet.
