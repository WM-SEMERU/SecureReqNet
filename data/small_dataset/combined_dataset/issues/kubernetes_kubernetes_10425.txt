Unable to revoke docker credentials


Steps to repro:

put a .dockercfg in /root/.dockercfg with credentials for a private repository
run a pod that uses an image from that repository.  it will succeed.
stop the pod
delete the .dockercfg
restart the kubelet
remove the image with docker rmi -f [privateimagename]
docker logout
verify that you cannot manually pull the private image with a node-local docker pull.
run the pod again.   magically, the image is still pulled. ðŸ˜•
