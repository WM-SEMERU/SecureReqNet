The current doc block example for ArrayInput seems to imply that the command name goes in as name, but this is actually just a random argument, named "name", in this case.
new ArrayInput(['name' => 'foo', '--bar' => 'foobar']);
It might be more helpful to provide an example that works with Symfony's Console component out of the box, as that is a common use case:
new ArrayInput(['command' => 'foo:bar', 'foo' => 'bar', '--bar' => 'foobar']);
