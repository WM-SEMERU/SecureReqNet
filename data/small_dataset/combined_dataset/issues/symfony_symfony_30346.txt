[Messenger] Use transport agnostic exceptions instead of throwing AMQPException


Description
If using AMQP, and RabbitMQ is not available, for example, dispatching a message through the bus will throw AMQPExceptions. I think this should be hidden for the client code that uses the bus, since the actual transport may vary.
Example
try {
      $this->messageBus->dispatch((new SampleMessage());
} catch (\AMQPException $e) {
    // Do sth
}```
