/deep/, >>>, and ::ng-deep will be deprecated. Any alternative?


As docs say /deep/, >>>, and ::ng-deep will be deprecated, so what's the alternative?
Here is the problem:
I have a component.
<app-mycomp>
    <h2>Some Text...</h2>
</app-mycomp>
mycomp.component.html:
<div class="title">
    <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
I need to style h2 in mycomp.component.css (not in other files)
h2{ margin: 0px;}
But it is not working because of encapsulation, so I used ::ng-deep:
::ng-deep h2{margin: 0px;}
but the docs say ::ng-deep will be deprecated. what's the alternative?
