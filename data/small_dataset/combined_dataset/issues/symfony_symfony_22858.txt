Always registers the command as a service even if no encoders are configured so that it is not auto-registered via reflection.
Prevents an irrelevant deprecation when no encoders are configured and, if a day the per-convention command registration is removed, ensures that the command always exists (leading to an exception saying that you have no configured encoder, better than nothing).
