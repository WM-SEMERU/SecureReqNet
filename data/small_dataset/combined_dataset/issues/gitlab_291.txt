'Hello.

I want to back up remote repository (online repository at GitLab.org ).
I didn't install gitlab on my own server.
I don't wish it.

I read https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/raketasks/backup_restore.md ,
And I tryed according to this.

But the below message was shown.

====================================================

bundle exec rake origin:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
rake aborted!
No Rakefile found (looking for: rakefile, Rakefile, rakefile.rb, Rakefile.rb)

(See full trace by running task with --trace)

====================================================

in the first place„ÄÅcan I realize it (backup of online repository) ?
