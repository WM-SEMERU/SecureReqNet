Screenshots
Fully secure HTTPS site (behavior unchanged) https://badssl.com/

HTTPS site with certificate error (green lock is now hidden) https://expired.badssl.com/

HTTPS site with mixed content (green lock is now hidden) https://www.bennish.net/mixed-content.html

HTTP unsecure site (behavior unchanged) http://neverssl.com/

Notes for testing this patch
Previously, all sites with URLs that begin with https had the green lock icon in the url bar. This change hides the green lock when browsing sites with certificate errors or mixed content.
Note that sites with certificate errors or mixed content are now treated the same as unsecure HTTP sites. This matches iOS Safari's behavior.
QA Steps:

Create a new tab and navigate to https://badssl.com/. The green lock should be visible.
Tap the "expired" link, which goes to https://expired.badssl.com/. The green lock should be hidden.
Create a new tab and navigate to https://www.bennish.net/mixed-content.html. The green lock should be hidden.
Create a new tab and navigate to http://neverssl.com/. The green lock should be hidden.
