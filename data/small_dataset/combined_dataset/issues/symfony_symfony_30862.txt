I noticed that I need to generate absolute urls quite often. For example when normalizing uploads in API. I found Twig's absolute_url() really helpful, but obviously Symfony\Bridge\Twig\Extension\HttpFoundationExtension cannot be used as a normalizer's argument service.
In this PR I propose to extract HttpFoundationExtension::generateAbsoluteUrl and HttpFoundationExtension::generateRelativePath to separate interfaces which could be used on their own. Although this could be just a final class helper, I thought that we might leave a possibility for decoration here. That's why I created interfaces.

 Split HttpFoundationExtension into two interfaces
 Deprecate HttpFoundationExtension::generateAbsoluteUrl and HttpFoundationExtension::generateRelativePath
 Add service definitions
 Fix tests
 Add docs
