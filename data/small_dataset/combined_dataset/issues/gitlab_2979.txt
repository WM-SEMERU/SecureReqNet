'Hey people,

I'm building a little iOS App for GitLab (http://www.somerobots.com), anyway I've noticed that when authenticating with the REST API - despite having Two Factor Authentication enabled on my account, the REST API does not require my Authentication token generated by the Google Authenticator App. 

Would love to see this fixed so I can put 2 factor auth in the App.
