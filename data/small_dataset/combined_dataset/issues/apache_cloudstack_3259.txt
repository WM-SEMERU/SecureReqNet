[WIP DO NOT MERGE] server: export granular volume bytes and iops metrics


Problem: The VM metrics has aggregated volume bytes read/write and iops metrics but not on per volume basis.
Root Cause: The volume stats sub-system is not used to export the metrics, the support is not available for VMware.
Solution: Use the volume stats sub-system and DB table to export the metrics via the listVolumes and listVolumeMetrics API, and implement support for VMware.
