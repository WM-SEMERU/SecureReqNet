Debug form type extensions in console


Debugging form in console
php bin/console debug:form

Appears many times as type extensions configured with new getExtendedTypes method. May cause confusion thinking you've got this extension registered twice or something like that. I think a good option is to put nearby these lines the extended type.
What do you think?
Now
Type extensions

App\Form\Extension\HTMLPurifierTextTypeExtension
App\Form\Extension\HTMLPurifierTextTypeExtension

After
Type extensions

App\Form\Extension\HTMLPurifierTextTypeExtension [TextType::class]
App\Form\Extension\HTMLPurifierTextTypeExtension [ChoiceType::class]
