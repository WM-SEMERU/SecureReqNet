Unable to use dictionary with the new format


Describe the problem and steps to reproduce it:
I simply add new uploaded Persian spell dictionary to Mozila Firefox.
What happened?
It doesn't list under language menu (for spell checking)
What did you expect to happen?
It should listed properly. Older versions work fine.
Anything else we should know?
I have uploaded this new version with the new format. Shall I continue with older format?
