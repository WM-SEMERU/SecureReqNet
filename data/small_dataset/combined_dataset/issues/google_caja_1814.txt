Remaining freeze violations among v8 array methods

Lists the following methods as potentially problematic, though by different criteria:

Array.prototype.unshift
Array.prototype.splice
Array.prototype.shift
Array.prototype.pop
Array.prototype.sort

We need to test each of these to determine whether they violate freeze safety, and if so, repair them. The good new is that, unlike push, probably none of these are as performance critical for the code we care about, and so we can afford to replace them.
