ui: Expands create-listeners API to allow recursive addition and plain function addition


This PR expands/improves upon the `create-listeners' utility which we added in #4859

Adds a Listeners class.
Point 1 lets us then add Listeners recursively. So you can createListeners().add(createListeners()) (or using the Mixin this.listen(somethingThatReturnsListeners())
Also add the ability to .add as a plain function as a teardown function

This moves the entire idea more towards a generic teardown utility, potentially at some point in the future this could be renamed to reflect that.
Additionally, using the function that is returned from adding a listener to tear it back down again wouldn't clean up the function from the internal listeners array meaning that this array could potentially grow unnecessarily. We aren't using this functionality anywhere currently but this functionality now cleans up correctly incase we ever do (also see removed comments)
To note: All of this functionality is now 'inherited' by the WithListeners Mixin which is basically an ember specific wrapper to create-listeners
Lastly we aren't using any of this extra functionality as yet (but will be), but we've added some additional tests here.
