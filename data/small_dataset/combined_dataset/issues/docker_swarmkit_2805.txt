Refactor condition in restart supervisor


Small change to refactor a condition in the restart supervisor's shouldRestart method. The old condition made my brain hurt. This should make it easier for everyone to understand.
Skipping the usual pull request boilerplate because this is such a tiny refactor with no user-facing impact, which passes the unit tests.
