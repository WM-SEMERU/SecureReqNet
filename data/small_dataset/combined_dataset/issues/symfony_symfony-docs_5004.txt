Tip for multiple authentication mechanisms


In the Form login chapter of the Cookbook there is an example of security.yml configuration:
# app/config/security.yml
security:
    # ...

    firewalls:
        default:
            anonymous: ~
            http_basic: ~
            form_login:
                login_path: /login
                check_path: /login_check
In this example two different authentication methods are used in the same firewall. There was a small section in book/security/authentication.rst with the following explanation:

When the user is not authenticated and if there is more than one authentication mechanisms, Symfony2 automatically defines a default entry point (in the example above, the login form; but if the user send an Authorization HTTP header with wrong credentials, Symfony2 will use the HTTP basic entry point).

But in this commit it was deleted and now I can't find anything about the behavior of such configuration in Symfony documentation. This example is a bit confusing for novices, so it will be great to restore a small tip about how it works.
