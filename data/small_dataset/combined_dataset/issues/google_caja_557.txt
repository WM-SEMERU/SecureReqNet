verify javascript toUpperCase is independent of locale


Original issue 557 created by felix8a on 2008-06-12T19:43:22.000Z:
es3 specifies a separate method toLocaleUpperCase, but it's not clear from
the description of toUpperCase that it's guaranteed to be
locale-independent.  need to verify this for the common browsers.
