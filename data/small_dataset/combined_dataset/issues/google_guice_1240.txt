 Change infrastructure to allow using java8-isms.
fd04a9e

 Some more infrastructure changes to work w/ java8 code.  Namely, neuter ant so that we don't use it for anything other than javadoc & jdiff.  A few of the libraries it depended on (jarjar, bnd) didn't work with java8 code.  We don't really need ant (we just use it for javadocs & jdiffs right now, and theoretically those could move to mvn too if someone figures out how to do that).

 Stop using reflection to access MethodHandle MethodHandles.Lookups.  Continue using reflection to access the private constructor for MethodHandles.Lookups.  See https://github.com//issues/904 for more information on why we need that particular bit of reflection.

 Refactor exception-message assertions to use ThrowableSubject.hasMessageThat(). This replaces assertions of the form assertThat(e).hasMessage(...) and assertThat(e.getMessage()) with assertThat(e).hasMessageThat().

 Add a note in isTransparentProvider that folks who trace through the code & detect that their binding isn't working because of this call should use @Bind(lazy=true) instead.
