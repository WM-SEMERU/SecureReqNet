HTTP Error 502.5 - ANCM Out-Of-Process Startup Failure


After wading through tons and tons of documentation and errors, I believe I have a truly unique underlying issue.
Right now I'm getting Failed to start application '/LM/W3SVC/31/ROOT', ErrorCode '0x8007023e'. in my event viewer.
The most common error I've had is
Application '/LM/W3SVC/31/ROOT' with physical root 'C:\Inetpub\vhosts\tmlinc.net\subdomains\cd\' failed to start process with commandline 'dotnet .\test.dll' at stage 'CreateProcessW', ErrorCode = '0x80070002', assigned port 19731, retryCounter '0'.  which I cannot find anywhere.  It seems to be unique.
I'm getting either 500 or 502 errors.  ACNM seems to be the issue.
I've tried enable debug output, but no output log is produced.
<configuration>
  <location path="." inheritInChildApplications="false">
    <system.webServer>
      <handlers>
        <add name="aspNetCore" path="*" verb="*" modules="AspNetCoreModuleV2" resourceType="Unspecified" />
      </handlers>
      <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" arguments=".\test.dll" stdoutLogEnabled="false" stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" hostingModel="InProcess">
	    <handlerSettings>
    <handlerSetting name="debugLevel" value="file" />
    <handlerSetting name="debugFile" value="c:\temp\ancm.log" />
  </handlerSettings>
	  </aspNetCore>
    </system.webServer>
  </location>
</configuration>

I repaired(reinstalled) .Net Core 2.2.3.  Installed VC++ Redistributable
I've also tried OutOfProcess.
I can run with dotnet .\test.dll.  It opens up port 5000 and I can connect in a local browser.
I have tried enabling stdoutlogfile.  I get empty log files.
I tried taking everything out of my main() and replacing it with Console.WriteLine("test") and File.WriteAllLines("abc", new List<string>(){"test"});
I have tried setting AspNetCoreModuleV2 to AspNetCoreModule.
I think I'm out of things to try here.
