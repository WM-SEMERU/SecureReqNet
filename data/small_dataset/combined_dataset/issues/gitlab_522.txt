When running 

```bash
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production
```

I get the following error

```bash
Check GitLab API access: FAILED. code: 404
gitlab-shell self-check failed
  Try fixing it:
  Make sure GitLab is running;
  Check the gitlab-shell configuration file:
  sudo -u git -H editor /home/git/gitlab-shell/config.yml
  Please fix the error above and rerun the checks.
```

I have "cleared" the config and replaced it with the "example" config (obviously adjusting parts to my server); but the error still occurs

None of my users can actually commit with keys, and the authorized_keys file seems to be screwed up. Could this be something to do with this error?
