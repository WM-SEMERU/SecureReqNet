I would like to discuss possibilities to fix #23208 (also see closed duplicate #24306).
The proposed solution in this PR is to simply not dump the parsed expression but simply the "raw" expressions
Question: Will this have a big negative performance impact? As far as I understand the ExpressionLanguage should have a cache anyway for parsed expressions? Or not?
Idea: maybe we can add an additional CacheWarmer that warms the cache for all those expressions?
Or is there a way to perform the compilation into parsed expressions at the very end of the container compilation when we could instantiate the actual ExpressionLanguage service with all its custom extensions?
Edit: the new approach is to still dump the parsed expressions but we do it using the "real" expression language service with all custom extensions.
