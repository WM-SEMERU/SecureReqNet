Image access control is not multi-tenant.


Docker does a credential check when pulling images, but not when using them. It will let you run an image that is already pulled even if you don't present credentials.
That is reasonable behavior from the standpoint of the docker tool since it is not trying to be multi-user.
However, it makes it hard to make Kubernetes multi-user. If an image is already pulled, (e.g. using imagePullSecrets, then anyone else can use that image by setting pull policy to IfNotPresent, even if they lack proper credentials.
We could try to fix this by disallowing IfNotPresent pull policy on all pods, thus forcing a docker pull before each docker run, and failing the pod if the docker pull failed.  We would need to implement and e2e test that.
