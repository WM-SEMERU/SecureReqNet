Mailto can be spam-clicked with jQuery




Did you search for similar issues before submitting this one?
Yes


Description:
Using jQuery, a malicious website can spam document.querySelector('a').click(); to click on an anchor tag such as jQuery('#result').append('<a href="mailto:popup@example.com">.</a>');. This will open the native iOS Mail app without asking permission from the user. Done in a loop, this click() call can endlessly redirect the user from Brave to Mail with a new email draft. This popup technique is still being used by iPhone Support scammers.
