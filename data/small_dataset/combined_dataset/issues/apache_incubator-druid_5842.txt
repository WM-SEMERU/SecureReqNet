Security - add anonymous authenticator


Anonymous authenticator will authenticate all requests and then direct them to an authorizer. See #5821 (This pull request will probably replace 5821). This anonymous authenticator is similar to allowAll authenticator in that it will authenticate every request but the anonymous authenticator will point to a custom authorizer (such as the basic authorizer in the config below).
Example usage in common.runtime.properties
druid.auth.authenticatorChain=["MyBasicAuthenticator","anonymous"]

druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.type=basic
druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.initialAdminPassword=password1
druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.initialInternalClientPassword=password2
druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.authorizerName=MyBasicAuthorizer

druid.auth.authenticator.anonymous.type=anonymous
druid.auth.authenticator.anonymous.authorizerName=MyBasicAuthorizer
druid.auth.authenticator.anonymous.identity=tester

# Escalator
druid.escalator.type=basic
druid.escalator.internalClientUsername=druid_system
druid.escalator.internalClientPassword=password2
druid.escalator.authorizerName=MyBasicAuthorizer

druid.auth.authorizers=["MyBasicAuthorizer"]
druid.auth.authorizer.MyBasicAuthorizer.type=basic

The anonymous authenticator would be added to the end of the authentication chain so if a user sends a request which fails the first part of the chain, the request will succeed or fail depending on the authorizer linked to the anonymous authenticator and how it's configured.
