[Security][Acl] Improve PermissionMap and MaskBuilder


When we work with symfony/ACL, sometimes it can be usefull to customize the PermissionMap and/or to use a different MaskBuilder.
I'd like to make them more easy to use and to customize.
To do it, we just have to add :

a MaskBuilderInterface (with the get/set/add/remove/reset methods)
a getMaskBuilder() method in the PermissionMapInterface which returns a new instance of the MaskBuilder you use, so you can easily retrieve the MaskBuilder used by the "security.acl.permission.map" service, even if it is a custom MaskBuilder

What do you think ?
