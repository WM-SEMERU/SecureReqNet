repairES5 inTestFrame() assumes document.body exists


Original issue 1830 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-08-05T23:29:49.000Z:
inTestFrame uses document.body, which does not exist if SES is loaded from the <head>, causing an unexpected error.
(The test in question is already protected against having no DOM at all.)
