AMBARI-25013. New kerberos-env property to allow populating auth_to_local rules for non installed service components


What changes were proposed in this pull request?
Ambari should optionally generate auth-to-local rules for the Kerberos identities of all components of installed services.
Currently Ambari will generate auth-to-local rules for the installed components of installed services. This is generally the accepted behavior. However, there may be cases where identities from remote clusters (using the same Kerberos realm) need to be translated to local names.
A use case may be that some slave component for a service is installed on a remote cluster, but that component is not installed on the local cluster. However a master component of that service is installed on the local cluster and the slave component from the remote cluster needs to communicate with it.
The solution is to add a new property to kerberos-env, maybe named include_all_components_in_auth_to_local_rules, where the default value is false. If set to true, when building the auth-to-local rules, Ambari should add the rules for all components of installed services, not just the installed components (which is what it does today).
How was this patch tested?
Added new unit test to cover this case:

Additionally the following E2E test has been executed:

installed a cluster with HDFS (and Kafka, but it's irrelevant now since Kafka does not support our auth to local feature) without NFSGateway



applied my changes (replaced the server JAR with the new one and edited the kerberos-env.xml to have the new property)
Kerberized the cluster



checked hadoop.security.auth_to_local within HDFS / Configs / Advanced / Advanced core-site. As expected the auth to local rules contained the rule for not installed components (NFSGatwway, JournalNode) too



Successfully installed and started an instance of NFSGateway on c7402
