Consul ACLs - Keyring Policy


Overview of the Issue
Iâ€™m enabling consul ACLs and have an anonymous policy defined. I wanted to restrict access to kv vault/ path (to prevent accidental deletes), prevent keyring commands, and operator commands, without authenticating first (and being an admin). All seems working, except for the keyring policy. If I set the keyring policy to deny or read, I can still run commands like consul keyring -install=new_key_here as anonymous, also same with the -remove flag. I tested with 1.0.7 consul originally, but also just tested with 1.2.0. Also, I have a default allow policy "acl_default_policy": "allow",
Reproduction Steps
anonymous.json payload file:
{
  "ID": "anonymous",
  "Type": "client",
  "Rules": "key \"vault/\" { policy = \"deny\" } keyring = \"deny\" operator = \"deny\""
}

Install anonymous policy into consul:
curl --request PUT --header "X-Consul-Token: secret_mgmt_token" --data @anonymous.json http://consul_server:8500/v1/acl/create
What I see happen
Validate no token set, so using anonymous policy, install new key, removed an older key works.
$ consul keyring -list
==> Gathering installed encryption keys...
error: Unexpected response code: 500 (Reading keyring denied by ACLs)
$ consul keygen

$ consul keyring -remove=R8or7dfK0MhZlrsuD6oMpQ==
