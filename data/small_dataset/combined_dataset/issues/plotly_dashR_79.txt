Provide helpful error message when requested dependency is not found


As described by @KPhans, get_package_mapping() throws a bit of an obscure error when dependency resolution fails. This probably occurs when the dependency name is not matched in the package_map object:
Error in get_package_mapping: 'package' must be of length 1'.
We should return a user-friendly error message here, so that app users understand that the problem is dependency-related, and so that app and component library developers can troubleshoot more easily during their build process.
The offending lines are linked below:

 result <- c(pkg_name=ifelse("package" %in% names(x), x$package, NULL), 



 dep_name=x$name, 



 dep_path=gsub("//+", replacement = "/", dep_path)
