Hello,

I’ve found a security vulnerability that causes all protected variables to be exposed to CI jobs running on every branch, regardless of whether that branch is actually protected or not.

To reproduce, simply set a wildcard for protected tags, like so:

This makes GitLab think that every time the CI is running, it’s running on a protected branch. I’ve set up a public repository that demonstrates this: https://gitlab.com/wescossick/protected-variables-exposed <https://gitlab.com/wescossick/protected-variables-exposed>.

Notice the following secret variables:

And the runner output for the following unprotected branch: https://gitlab.com/wescossick/protected-variables-exposed/-/jobs/35772011 <https://gitlab.com/wescossick/protected-variables-exposed/-/jobs/35772011>. Screenshot of output:

I would appreciate public acknowledgement <https://about.gitlab.com/vulnerability-acknowledgements/> for finding this vulnerability once it is resolved.
