net/http, net/http/cgi: fix HTTP_PROXY security issue


Because,

The CGI spec defines that incoming request header "Foo: Bar" maps to environment variable HTTP_FOO == "Bar". (see RFC 3875 4.1.18)
The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is conventionally used to configure the HTTP proxy for HTTP clients (and is respected by default for Go's net/http.Client and Transport)

That means Go programs running in a CGI environment (as a child process under a CGI host) are vulnerable to an incoming request containing "Proxy: attacker.com:1234", setting HTTP_PROXY, and changing where Go by default proxies all outbound HTTP requests.
This is CVE-2016-5386, aka https://httpoxy.org/
