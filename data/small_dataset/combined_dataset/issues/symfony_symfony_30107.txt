Regression transChoice / bug trans() when count is a non-castable integer


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.3
Description
There is a regression with the now deprecated transChoice function/Twig filter.
It is also a bug with the new synthax: transChoice + %count% token
How to reproduce
This used to work on Symfony 4.1:
{% set count = 1100|number_format(0, '.', ' ') %}

{{ '{0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf[ There are %count% apples'|trans({'%count%': count}) }}

 or

{% transchoice count %}
{0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf[ There are %count% apples
{% endtranschoice %}
There are 1100 apples or There are 1100 apples
This does not work anymore with Symfony 4.2:
{0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf[ There are 1 100 apples or {0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf[ There are 1 100 apples
The new synthax is also impacted by the issue:
{% set count = 1100|number_format(0, '.', ' ') %}
{{ '{0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf[ There are %count% apples'|trans({'%count%': count}) }}

{0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf[ There are 1 100 apples
Issue

If count = 1100 (int) or count = '1100' (string), it works.
If count = '1 100', it doesn't work anymore.
