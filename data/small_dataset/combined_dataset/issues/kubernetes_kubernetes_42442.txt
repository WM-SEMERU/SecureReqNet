Log redirect wrapper for system container images


We have a common pattern of system container images that package a single go binary, but rely on a shell command simply to redirect the logs (rescheduler, kube-controller-manager, kube-apiserver, etc.). It would be nice to remove the shell dependency for these images (to reduce the attack surface and image management). This could be done making changes to the binaries directly to pass the log destination, but that means the binaries must have write permissions (often root) to the log locations.
I propose instead a simple wrapper program that takes:

Command & arguments to execute
File location for output redirection
(optional) uid & gid to run subcommand as

We could provide this in a scratch based image, and rebase images following this pattern on this.
