caja now allows iframe src= in static html


Original issue 1108 created by felix8a on 2009-08-20T14:21:47.000Z:
r3652 which added support for iframe shims
also allows iframes in static html.
so if you cajole
<iframe src="http://google.com">
caja will happily emit that.
the urlpolicy gets to rewrite the url (as mimeType=="text/html"),
but this is new behavior.  a urlpolicy might not expect to
handle an iframe src url, and might do the wrong thing with it.
