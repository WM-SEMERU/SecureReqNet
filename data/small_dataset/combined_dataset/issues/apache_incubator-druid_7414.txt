Adding ability to pass configs in and fixing misc bugs


Adding a rudimentary mechanism for Druid to pass configs to the console (by overriding the web-console/console-config.js file) for future extensibility.
Also making misc fixes:

Add missing addOnBlur for tag input
Remove extra margin in column selector
Fix column name capitalization in lookup view
Lookup view will now confirm deleting a lookup (like all the other views do)
Lookup view will not show option to Initialize lookups on errors other than 404 and will correctly display a legitimate error
Avoid using display: none to hide elements

Lookup delete confirmation:
