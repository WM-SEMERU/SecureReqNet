Current default behavior for EmailConstraint is to use the loose mode, this mode uses the regexp /^.+\@\S+\.\S+$/ which considers email addresses starting with whitespace characters as valid.
So for instance, these emails are considered valid (which does not seem to be the case... at least, they broke my application):
 foo@example.com

foo@example.com foo@example.com

The strict mode already consider those email addresses as invalid 👏... but it's a shame to have to rely on a third party library only because of some whitespace characters 😞
As a fix, I propose the regexp: /^\S+\@\S+\.\S+$/.
I didn't find anything explaining why this is not already the default regexp...
To avoid BC breaks, I suggest to merge this in 5.x, but it's up to you.
