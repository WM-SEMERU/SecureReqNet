Add a getJson helper method to automatically decode a JSON request string to an array.
This is useful in the cases when using, for example, Axios to do AJAX requests. The request content cannot be retrieved using the $request->request object and is only available using the getContent method (which just returns the full JSON string and needs to be manually decoded).
