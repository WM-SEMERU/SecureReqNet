Users Whitelist



nomad needs a user.whitelist. having to blacklist hundreds of user accounts to satisfy security reqs is a PITA.

Currently nomad allows blacklisting running tasks as certain users (such as root). For locking down a system a whitelist is much more succinct and easier to implement correctly.
Nomad should have a user.whitelist setting to allow specifying exactly what users tasks can run as.
