ca: Fix restarts of the CA server


We start the CA server when we become the leader. We stop the CA server
when we're no longer the leader.
The Run function has protection against being called multiple times,
which is good. But if we shut down the CA, we need to be able to start
it again later, so Stop needs to reset this channel.
