Append "AppArmor enabled" to the Node ready condition message


As discussed, add a "AppArmor enabled" message to the node ready condition message. This is a temporary solution to surfacing the AppArmor status until node feature reporting is enabled.
Example:
$ kubectl get nodes e2e-test-stclair-minion-group-lmvk -o yaml
...
  - lastHeartbeatTime: 2016-08-30T00:52:11Z
    lastTransitionTime: 2016-08-30T00:43:28Z
    message: kubelet is posting ready status. AppArmor enabled
    reason: KubeletReady
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
...


1.4 justification:

Risk: Low. This is a small change to append a human readable message.
Rollback: Nothing depends on this functionality.
Cost: Not knowing whether AppArmor is actually supported by a node. Although pods should be rejected if it's not enabled, we can't do anything for older (< v1.4) nodes. This positive affirmation provides confirmation that AppArmor is enabled for the current version.
