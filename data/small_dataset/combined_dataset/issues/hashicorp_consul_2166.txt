v1/health/state/passing is not protected by ACL


Excactly the setup from #2163
curl http://consul:8500/v1/health/state/passing  | grep fpm
"CheckID":"fpm55","Name":"fpm TCP on port 9055","Status":"passing","Notes":"","Output":"TCP connect localhost:9055: Success",

while services are not listed at all
curl http://consul:8500/v1/catalog/services
{"consul":[]}%

Those curl commands have been run on the same instance, remotely on a consul port running a container - so not credentials whatever
