'The `rails_deprecated_sanitizer` gem was added in !1902 when updating to Rails 4.2.4. Apparently it was thought to be needed for ActiveJob mailers? I'm basing that on [this commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/7f214cee74796ceaf7b01bd6e133d4d54c5123db).

I can't find any discussion on this, and when I remove the gem and replace it with `rails-html-sanitizer` it works just fine. I'm running the test suite right now, so we'll see if any of them fail, but as far as I can tell there's no reason to use the deprecated gem. If we needed the deprecated sanitizer we should have been using it since 4.2.0 when the gem was originally created. 

Reasons to remove it:
- It's deprecated, obviously
- Once Rails 5 ships, support for it will be dropped entirely, e.g. no more security fixes
- rails-html-sanitizer is faster
