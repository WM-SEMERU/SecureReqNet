Bug fixes:

Fixed connections occasionally broken by the unrelated use of the
multiprocessing module (ðŸŽ«[#829](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/829)).
Fixed async communication blocking if results are returned in different
chunks, e.g. with notices interspersed to the results (ðŸŽ«[#856](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/856)).
Fixed adaptation of numeric subclasses such as ~enum.IntEnum
(ðŸŽ«[#591](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/591)).

Other changes:

Dropped support for Python 2.6, 3.2, 3.3.
Dropped psycopg1 module.
