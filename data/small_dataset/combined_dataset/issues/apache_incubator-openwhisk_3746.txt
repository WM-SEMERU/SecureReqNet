There are a number of steps required to configure an openwhisk deployment so that it address  security concerns. I list some of these below and we should document these and add examples for how to secure a deployment.

 networking configuration to secure action containers
 namespaces (root inside container vs outside)
 dns resolver
 enabling encrypted communication between the components
 using proper certificates for ssl termination
