Refactor repairES5


Original issue 1878 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-12-20T23:47:08.000Z:
Per comments in r5650, https://codereview.appspot.com/44260044/ :
repairES5 should be able to handle:

a repair which is performed some time after repairES5.js runs to completion (in particular, in WeakMap.js)
running tests and updating ses.ok-ness after repairES5.js runs to completion (in particular, after startSES.js has frozen everything, because some repairs can only truly be verified then)
