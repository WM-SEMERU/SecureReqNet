Brave crashes when trying to close or open tabs for certain websites


Description
When opening or closing tabs for certain websites Brave crashes.
Steps to Reproduce
Certain examples (but not limited to):


open browser, open several (5-6) tabs and go anywhere (let's say you go to github.com)


open a new tab, go to mail.google.com, do stuff


click the close tab X icon


Brave crashes


do the same as above only instead of going to mail.google.com go to news.google.com


right click on any link to a news site away from google, click "open link in new tab"


Brave crashes about 60-70% of the time


There are several other sites that cause the browser to crash, I simply can't remember them all.
