Trademarking completely broken. Also violates freezing constraints.


Original issue 421 created by erights on 2008-06-09T02:13:58.000Z:
var x = caja.freeze({});
var y = caja.freeze({});
caja.hasTrademark(x, y); // returns false
caja.audit(x, y);
caja.hasTrademark(x, y); // returns true
The problem is that audit() was made accessible as caja.audit, enabling
anyone to claim that anything is audited as anything. Besides making
trademarking completely pointless, audit() also applies its trademark to
already-constructed objects whether they are frozen or not. Above we
demonstrate a visible difference of behavior after invoking a supposedly
immutable object (caja) with only immutable arguments.
audit() should be renamed stamp(). It should be accessible only as
___.stamp(), and it should only be able to apply a trademark to a
constructed object if applied during construction.
