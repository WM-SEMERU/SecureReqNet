Rename StreamPipeReaderOptions to StreamPipeReaderAdapterOptions


Description
Changes the name of StreamPipeReaderOptions to StreamPipeReaderAdapterOptions to avoid a name collision with System.IO.Pipelines.
Reason for change
Builds will fail without this change, saying that there is a nameconflict on StreamPipeReaderOptions.
What commit caused this failure
dotnet/corefx@dc965e1 caused this name conflict and upgrading dependencies caught it.
Why wasn't it caught earlier?
Upgrading dependencies takes too long and no one was on top of this earlier.
Any concerns of breaking changes?
This is a breaking change, but the type was unused and will be removed within the timeframe of preview4 to preview5.
