Typing the user class is quite annoying so I'd suggest to ask the user to select it using a choice question.
This changes however requires to inject configured encoders' user classes. Making the command a service and providing it in the constructor from the extension is probably the cleanest way, but it deprecates:

registering the command by convention (registered as a service now, so potential commands extending this one should do the same)
relying on the fact the command extends ContainerAwareCommand and implements ContainerAwareInterface (will not extends/implements it anymore in 4.0 because it's not required anymore)
