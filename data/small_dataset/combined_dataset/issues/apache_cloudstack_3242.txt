[WIP DO NOT MERGE] server: add support for sorting zones in UI/API


Problem: Not able to configure a sort order for the zone that are listed in various views in the UI.
Root Cause: There was no mechanism to accept sort key for existing zones or UI widget to drag them in a certain order.
Solution: The order can now be configured through the editZone API by providing sort_key parameter for zones, or by reordering the zones in the Zones list in the UI. Database changes include updating table “data_center” which contains the “sort_key” column containing integer values and defaults to zero.
