Secure sites listed as unsecure on restored tabs after restart


Observed behavior:  When opening Brave, restored tabs for secure sites have an open lock icon. (windows and osx)
Expected behavior: Brave should correctly identify secure sites as secure, in restored tabs on startup
How to reproduce:

Open several secure https sites in different tabs (google.com, yahoo.com, github.com).
Verify that they are secure by viewing the closed lock icon to the left of the url bar
close Brave via "Quit Brave" in hamburger menu
open Brave.  Previously-open tabs are auto-restored
The default active tab will have the correct secure lock icon, but other restored tabs will have an open 'insecure' lock until you manually refresh them.
