**Description:** 
A user with `Developer` role should not be able to create projects within a group if we go as per documentation.

However, they are allowed to create projects directly at `https://gitlab.com/<PrivateGroupName>`


## Steps To Reproduce:
1. As a developer in a group go to `https://gitlab.com/<PrivateGroupName>`
2. You will find a button to create project `New Project`
3. Click on it and give a appropriate name to the project
4. Project will be successfully created!

Regards,
Ashish
