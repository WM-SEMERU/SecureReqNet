Convert invisible characters to ? in Characters tokens


This prevents someone from using backspace and other invisible characters from
tricking a user into copy and pasting a seemingly innocuous command into doing
something they really don't want to do.
I made the replacement character a constant figuring people can replace it if
they want something different.
Fixes #298.
