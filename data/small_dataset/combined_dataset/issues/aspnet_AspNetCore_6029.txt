Please consider splitting the AzureAD package apart to reduce dependencies


I have a lightweight ASP.NET Core Web API project.  It has no front end, and thus doesn't need most of what is bundled with the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package.   I can generally use Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core package instead.
Except that I need AAD authentication, and when I pull in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI it takes Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc as a dependency...
Looking through the code, it seems like there are some controllers and pre-compiled Razor views being included, so I understand why you need the full Mvc package to support those.
It would be great if you could split out the core AAD auth from the UI components, such that those of us who don't need the UI don't need to take the dependency on the big Mvc package.  Something like this perhaps:

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.Core

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect





Thanks.
