javascript runtime mutability?


From nexina...@gmail.com on June 03, 2014 22:37:43
Is this report about the crypto library or the extension?
Possibly both, due to both using javascript
What is the security bug?
This is more a question than a definite exploit but does this project suffer from the fact that javascript functions (including the runtime) are mutable?
The front page says that "crypto operations are performed in a different process" which sounds like it is secure but could you talk about the mutability of javascript anyway and say that it is a non issue? An excellent writeup is at http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/ on why javascript and encryption is hard if not a fools errand, which is why the js OTR library warn journalists not to use it http://thechangelog.com/otr-js-off-the-record-protocol-in-javascript/
How would someone exploit it?
Could a webpage run this to modify the behaviour of the extension?
Math.random = function() { return 0; };
e2e.random = { ... };
(note this is hypothetical - I've never written a chrome extension and am not sure of the details of how extensions and webpages interact)
