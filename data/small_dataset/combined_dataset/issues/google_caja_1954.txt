JS minifier (optimizer) transforms comma expressions invalidly


Original issue 1956 created by kpreid@google.com on 2015-02-26T00:54:02.000Z:
The minifier incorrectly transforms
q = (1,y.z)();
to
q = y.z();
Additionally, I tried writing the obvious test case for this (in JsOptimizerTest.java) and it hung in an infinite loop inside ParseTreeKB.optimize:

public final void testCommaNotChanged() throws Exception {
assertOptimized(

   js(fromString(&quot;q = (1,y.z)();&quot;)),



   js(fromString(&quot;q = (1,y.z)();&quot;)));


}

This is not currently a vulnerability as we never use the (1,o.m)() form statically in any critical location. However, it is a significant hazard for future code changes (because we use this pattern in other ways and so it looks like a fine thing to do).
