Tracking: Kubernetes Product Security Response Plan


This is a tracking issue for creating, documenting, and exercising a Kubernetes Product Security Response Plan. The overall goal is to ensure that when a security vulnerability becomes known the entire Kubernetes community has processes, infrastructure, and communication channels to make an organized and responsible response for users.
The document describing the initial implementation of this plan is here.
Special thanks to the many folks who helped to review and make additions to this document: Kees Cook, Jess Frazelle, Matthew Garrett, Jordan Liggitt, Kurt Seifried, Davanum Srinivas, and many many more.
