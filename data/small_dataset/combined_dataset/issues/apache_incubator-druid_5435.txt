Skip normal authentication for JDBC requests in Router


Authentication for JDBC requests should use credentials stored in the JDBC connection context instead of the HTTP headers.
On the broker, DruidAvaticaHandler handles JDBC requests separately from the normal authentication checking filters.
On the router, JDBC requests currently go through the normal authentication checking filter which is extraneous/incorrect.
This PR sets the Avatica path as "unsecured" on the Router, deferring the authentication check to the broker where authentication will occur using the JDBC connection context.
