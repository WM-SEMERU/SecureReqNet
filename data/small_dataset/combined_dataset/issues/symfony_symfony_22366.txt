My Symfony project consists two user provider that is used in two different firewalls.
#app/config/security.yml

security:
    access_decision_manager:
        strategy: unanimous
    providers:
        ldap:
            id: some.security.user.provider
        fos_userbundle:
            id: fos_user.user_provider.username
    firewalls:
        some_other:
            provider:   fos_userbundle 
            pattern:    ^/some-route
            security:   true
            anonymous:  ~
            form_login:
                default_target_path: /some-route
                login_path:          /some-route/login
                check_path:          /some-route/login_check
                csrf_provider: security.csrf.token_manager
            logout:
                path:   /some-route/logout
                target: /some-route 
        main:
            provider: ldap
            pattern: ^/
            security: true
            anonymous: ~
            # other_form_login option was created to not using form_login
            # created by a factory that extend 
            # Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\DependencyInjection\Security\Factory\AbstractFactory
            other_form_login: 
                failure_handler: main.security.authentication.failure_handler
                success_handler: main.security.authentication.success_handler
            logout:
                path: /logout
                target: /


When I'm trying to login at /some-route/login using a username from ldap user provider, it succeeds even though I'm using fos_userbundle provider.
Here is what I have tried:


I tried to change user provider of main firewall to fos_userbundle, it doesn't succeeds anymore when I'm using a username from ldap user provider. But I must use the ldap provider for main firewall


When I'm logged in using /some-route/login with ldap user provider and going to / route, it shows anonymous on the toolbar which means it doesn't go to main firewall


I have tried to change main firewall route to ^/main but it still succeed when I'm trying to login with username from ldap provider.


EDIT: add other_form_login option that might be involved in generating this bug.
