Add Route Access Control


Can we add the "isGranted" method that comes with "FrameworkExtraBundle" to the route? We can use the Flex Yada Composer to secure the packages installed. Adding with Access_Control is laborious and inflexible. It can be useful for dynamically loaded routes.
admin_account_list:
    path:       /accounts
    controller: Example\ExampleBundle\AccountController::list
    methods: [GET, POST]
    isGranted: [ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_EDITOR, ROLE_VIEWER] // New Features

admin_account_edit:
    path:       /accounts/edit/{user}
    controller: Example\ExampleBundle\AccountController::edit
    methods: [GET, POST]
    isGranted: [ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_EDITOR] // New Features
