[ Security][Core][User][UserProviderInterface] Find user method


Core not realy should depend on username as unique value, more clear way is just loadUser() and Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface needs additional method like getUniqueProperty() for idetntify user.
Also username used in other structures by core so getUsername() method may be used for debuging purposes providing human readable values depending on apps.
