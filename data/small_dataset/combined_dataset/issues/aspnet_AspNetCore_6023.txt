Can't get the OnTokenValidated event


What's the proper way to add my custom claims to the validated token? I used to do it in the "OnTokenValidated" event by using something similar to:

builder.AddOpenIdConnect(o =>
             {
                o.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
                 {
                     OnTokenValidated = async ctx =>
                     {
                     ...

I'm no longer able to do this with the new AzureAD.UI package.
