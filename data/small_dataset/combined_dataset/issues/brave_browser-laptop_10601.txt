Describe the issue you encountered:

I am unable to find the fingerprint of the various PGP signing keys you use to sign Linux packages. Thus there is no way to know if the key you downloading at:
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brave-apt/keys.asc
Is actually the key meant to be there. Any malicious party with access to the AWS infrastructure could swap out malicious code and sign that with a fake key and it would seem "secure" to an end user.
The rest of the issue questions are irrelevant.
