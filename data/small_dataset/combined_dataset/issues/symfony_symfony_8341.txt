missing security translations


Exceptions in symfony/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/User/UserChecker.php are not translated. (and possibly more Exceptions)
this problem was already mentioned in #1835 and #837 but those tickets are closed and the problem still exist.
what makes this confusing is, that some exceptions are translated and some not.
f.e. class LockedException returns "Account is locked" and this is translated in security.{local}.xlf
this can be translated by creating translating file manually, but why should we do this?
any harcoded text in the framework should be translated, or refactored so it is stored in one place and can be easily overwritten and translated.
