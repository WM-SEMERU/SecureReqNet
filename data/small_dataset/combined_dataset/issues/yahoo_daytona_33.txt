Security Vulnerability


A security researcher discovered that an authenticated user (including a newly registered guest) could import a Zip file containing framework data. Although the extracted Zip file data is not stored in the web server document root, symbolic links created during the web app installation for "test_data" allow for PHP execution.
Steps to Reproduce
Important: Make sure to use a test account when reproducing these steps!

Export the DaytonaSampleFramework to a zip file under the user dropdown box -> Import/Export page.
Add a PHP file to the Zip archive as test.php in the DaytonaSampleFramework directory.
Import the Zip archive under the Import/Export page.
Browse to http://127.0.0.1/test_data/DaytonaSampleFramework/test.php and notice the uploaded PHP file is interpreted.
