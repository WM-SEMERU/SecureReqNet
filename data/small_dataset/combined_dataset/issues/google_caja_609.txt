Original issue 609 created by google@web.dwdw.me on 2008-06-14T00:39:33.000Z:
In domita.js's runtime HTML sanitization,
sanitizeHtml()/elementPolicies.a() seem to implement the following: If you
see an A tag, append a TARGET="_blank" attribute to the end of its
attribute list.  Problem: If the original A tag already contains another
TARGET attribute, say A TARGET="_parent", then the sanitized version seems
to be A TARGET="_parent" "_blank".  In other words, the original TARGET
attribute does not seem to be removed and I couldn't see any obvious
duplicate elimination.  I didn't test this, so this needs to be checked.
