refactor(fxa-auth-server): Added semicolons


fixes #2953.
Commands used to fix:
eslint --fix .
Also added
complexity: 0 and no-useless-escape: 0 because some errors were occuring due to the use of regex.
Have also added //eslint disable-next-line in validators.js, authorization.js, token.js and added /*eslint complexity: [2, 11] */ in summary.js manually because the errors no-useless-escape and complexity were still present.
Please review @shane-tomlinson.
