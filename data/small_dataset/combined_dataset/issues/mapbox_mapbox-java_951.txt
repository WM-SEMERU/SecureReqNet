Fix banner MAS models to match what actually comes from Directions API


As part of mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android#1543 work we've noticed that some banner Directions API / MAS models donâ€™t match each other completely matches and some annotations need to be fixed in MAS so they match what actually comes from the API. These are the changes needed:
BannerInstructions:
primary ðŸ‘‰ should be @NonNull
BannerText:
text ðŸ‘‰ should be @NonNull
UPDATED
type ðŸ‘‰ should be @NonNull
modifier ðŸ‘‰ should be @NonNull
BannerComponents:
text ðŸ‘‰ not specified and should be @NonNull
type ðŸ‘‰ not specified and should be @NonNull
