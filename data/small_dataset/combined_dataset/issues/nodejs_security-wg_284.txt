Alex Knol (@Elexy) into the third party triage team (and security working group)


Hi,
I propose Alex Knol (@Elexy) to become a member of the security working group and the third party triage team. He is a colleague of mine and has expressed his interest in helping with the triage of third
party modules.
I can totally back him up from the professional (and personal) point of view.
