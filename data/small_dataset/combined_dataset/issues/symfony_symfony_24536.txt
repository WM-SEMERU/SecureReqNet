I think this is a security hole - a user can remain logged in with a remember me cookie even though they can no longer pass UserCheckInterface::checkPostAuth() (could be disabled).
This is a small BC break but shouldn't be an issue as I think it is a bug. I don't think this requires a BC layer but if so, I can add.
