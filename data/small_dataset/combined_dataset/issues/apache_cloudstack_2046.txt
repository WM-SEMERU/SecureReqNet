CLOUDSTACK-7958: Add configuration for limit to CIDRs for Admin API calls


The global setting 'management.admin.cidr' is set to 0.0.0.0/0,::/0
by default preserve the current behavior and thus allow API calls
for Admin accounts from all IPv4 and IPv6 subnets.
Users can set it to a comma-separated list of IPv4/IPv6 subnets to
restrict API calls for Admin accounts to certain parts of their network(s).
This is to improve Security. Should a attacker steal the Access/Secret key
of a Admin account he/she still needs to be in a subnet from where Admin accounts
are allowed to perform API calls.
This is a good security measure for APIs which are connected to the public internet.
This PR also includes a commit to cleanup and improve NetUtils.
No existing methods have been altered. That has been verified by adding additional Unit Tests for this.
