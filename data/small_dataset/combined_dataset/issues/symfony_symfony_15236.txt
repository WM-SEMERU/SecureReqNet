InsufficientAuthenticationException is thrown and results in a 500 when I expect a 403


I'm using Symfony 2.3 and written something very similar to this cookbook entry (http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/cookbook/security/voters.html). I think my issue very much looks like #8467, although I believe my use case is different. Because I am not using a user provider at all, anonymous authentication is totally ok.
Now, InsufficientAuthenticationException is thrown with AccessDeniedException as a previous exception when I've denied access in my custom voter. I do not see why this first exception is thrown, since I just expect to return a 403 as a response and not a fatal 500.
Some more info: I've got two firewalls. One is ignoring all dev related paths. The other simply allows anonymous users. My security.yml looks like this:
security:
    encoders:
        Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\Person:
            id: acme.demo.blowfish_password_encoder

    providers:
        in_memory:
            memory: ~

    firewalls:
        dev:
            pattern: ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
            security: false

        default:
            anonymous: ~

    access_control:
        - { path: ^/, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }

    access_decision_manager:
        strategy: unanimous
Can anyone elaborate on this?
