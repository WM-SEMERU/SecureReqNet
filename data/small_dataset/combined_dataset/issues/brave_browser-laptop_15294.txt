Pop-ups blocked with no option to show


Description
Pop-ups appear to be blocked by default in Brave, but there is no way to allow them. In my particular case, my credit card provider has online statements, but clicking the link to the PDF uses Javascript to open the PDF in a new window. This is obnoxious of course, but I can't change their site, and without an option to allow the pop-up in Brave I have to switch to Firefox to get my credit card statements.
Steps to Reproduce

Go to any site which shows information in a pop-up window
Click the link to actuate the pop-up

Actual result:
The link does nothing
Expected result:
A dialog or information bar is shown asking if the pop-up should be shown
Reproduces how often:
100%
