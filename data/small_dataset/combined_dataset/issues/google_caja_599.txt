Test bed embeds unsanitized HTML in its error messages


Original issue 599 created by zestyping on 2008-06-13T17:14:57.000Z:
Cajole this:
<style>
.foo { background: url("http://foo/&lt;h1&gt;bar&lt;/h1>"); }
</style>
The error message will contain the <h1> tag unescaped.  This probably means
you can fool the testbed into embedding arbitrary unsanitized HTML into its
error messages.
