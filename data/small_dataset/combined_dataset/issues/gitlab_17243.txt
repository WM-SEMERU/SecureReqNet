Hello,

There's a full path disclosure bug when creating a new project, if the user tries to import the project from a git URL that doesn't exist, following are the steps to reproduce:

1. Login to your GitLab account and go to https://gitlab.com/projects/new, fill in any name for the project.
2. Enter http://strukt.tk/bla after clicking "Any repo by URL" in the "Import project from" section, and click "Create Project".
3. You will be presented by an error message that says that http://strukt.tk/bla doesn't exist and that "Cloning into bare repository ..." with the full path.

Regards
