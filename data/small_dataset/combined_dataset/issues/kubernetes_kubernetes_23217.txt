Bring PodSecurityPolicy to usable state


The PodSecurityPolicy object was merged by @pweil- in #7893.
That defined a new type, (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/apis/extensions/v1beta1/types.go#L919), a registry, kubectl support, and a client.
We still need to:

 expose the extension by default, and generate the docs for it.
 write code that decides whether a Pod create/update is allowed by any maching PSP. (assume this exists downstream in openshift.)
 decide on a way to determine which type applies to which requests; that is, something to bind request attributes, like user, groups, namespace, with the PSPs that apply to that pod.
 write admission controller code that does the previous two things and says yes or no to Pod creates/updates.
 define behavior when multiple PodSecurityPolicy objects allow a pod - #52849
 define a way for policy authors to affect which PSP is selected when multiple PodSecurityPolicy objects allow a pod - #52849
