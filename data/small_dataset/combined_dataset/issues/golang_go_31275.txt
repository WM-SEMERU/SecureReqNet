So it seems like BCE is actually getting worse in 1.13 for this particular package. It has over a hundred bounds checks, a dozen of which are in hot decode functions, so I'd like for the number to go down, not up :)
I used encoding/json from the master version on both cases, to make the comparison fair and simple.
