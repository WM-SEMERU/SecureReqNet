go get -mod=readonly updates go.mod


What version of Go are you using (go version)?
% go version
go version devel +964fe4b80f Thu Apr 4 00:26:24 2019 +0000 darwin/amd64

Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
yes
What did you do?
As part of my make test target I run
go get -mod=readonly honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck

What did you expect to see?
go.mod is not modified
What did you see instead?
go.mod is modified.
This is a problem because I do not want to record the version of honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck that was used in my go.mod file. I explicitly want to leave this version floating so that i automatically receive updates to that tool. I want to do this because this tool is not part of my project, its part of the tools I use to test my project, when they are updated, I want to receive those updates without go get dirtying go.mod every time I run my make check target
