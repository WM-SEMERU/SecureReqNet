PhpunitBridge tags declaring wrong PHP support should to be dropped or changed


There are symfony/phpunit-bridge 4.2.4 and 3.4.23 versions which declare support for PHP 5.3 but use PHP 5.4 syntax. Even when new version which fixes this will be released, this will not fix the issue, because if you test on PHP 5.3/5.4 and have
"require-dev": {"symfony/phpunit-bridge": "^3.0|4.0"}
composer will skip installing 4.2.5/3.4.24 and keep installing faulty version.
I suggest to exceptionally drop these faulty tags. Fortunately, there are no significant changes:
symfony/phpunit-bridge@v3.4.22...v3.4.23
symfony/phpunit-bridge@v4.2.3...v4.2.4
