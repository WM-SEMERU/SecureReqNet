Update Third-party Triage Team Permissions in HackerOne


What I expected
To be able to complete the triage process steps as a member of the triage team.
What I experienced
My account and the most of the other team members accounts lack the permissions required to triage a vulnerability because we can not add assets.
Solution

 Add the Program permission via groups on HackerOne to all triage team members, checkout the docs here.
