[DX] Impersonating users continuously without having to log out


The problem
Impersonating users is a great Symfony feature used by lots of companies providing customer support. When you provide support, is common to have to impersonate a lot of different users continuously.
The problem is that to impersonate different users, you have first to log out and then log in with the other user.
The solution
To improve DX and make end users more productive, Symfony could allow to impersonate different users without having to log out between them.
