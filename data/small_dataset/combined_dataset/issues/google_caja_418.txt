useGetAndCallHandlers() based on stale exophoric assumptions


Original issue 418 created by erights on 2008-06-09T01:44:01.000Z:
In caja.js, useGetAndCallHandlers is defined as
function useGetAndCallHandlers(constr, name, func) {
useGetHandler(constr, name, function() { return func; });
useCallHandler(constr, name, func);
}
it is then used throught the rest of caja.js to whitelist so-called generic
functions, or handlers around such functions, such that an attempt to read
that function will produce a function value that isn't attached to the
instance. The problem is that many of the functions in question mention
"this", or are primitive functions whose semantics imply they use their
"this" argument.
Back when we thought we were going to support explicit exophoric function
values as part of official wart-free Caja, this was a good plan. (And the
problematic functions in question are all tagged as xo4a.) However, we
dropped that plan because the existence of exophoric values creates too
many dangers elsewhere. These uses of useGetAndCallHandlers continue to
make these hazards available.
