"cluster inspect" prints bcrypted secret


cluster inspect has the following code:
                        if policy.Secret != nil {
                                fmt.Fprintf(w, "    Secret\t: %v\n", string(policy.Secret.Data))
                        }

This appears to be printing bcrypted data. Since one would have reverse the hash to make any use of this output, what's the point of including it in the output?
