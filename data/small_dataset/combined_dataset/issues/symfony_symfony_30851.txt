Mainly for API-based apps that don't require TwigBundle to get the correct exception response according to the request format (aka _format attribute).

Let me know if this classify as a bugfix for 4.2, but IMHO this was never supported without TwigBundle, hence master branch.

throw new NotFoundHttpException('Resource not found.', null, 0, ['Content-Type' => 'application/problem+json']);
