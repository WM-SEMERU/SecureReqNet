Query for user on every request in user provider service.


I`m using Symfony's Security component with custom user provider service (due to using mongodb as default users storage).
In security.yml:
    providers:
        entity:
            id: fw.user_provider

in services.yml:
    fw.user_provider:
        class: FW\UserBundle\Services\UserProvider
        arguments: [@doctrine.odm.mongodb.document_manager]

Query to find out user in mongo collection in locatd in loadUserByUserName method.
I see in profiler that query to mongodb to find out user is executed on every request, not only after submitting login form.
Is this behaviour correct? I think it's a little performance issue. Maybe user object should be stored in session?
