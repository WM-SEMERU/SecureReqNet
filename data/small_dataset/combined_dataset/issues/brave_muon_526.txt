Add CA(s) to support Amazon Certificate Manager


In #12190 / #401 we pinned certs for Brave domains.
Several of our services (such as sync.brave.com) use LetsEncrypt currently but the renewal workflow is manual.
To simplify ops, we're interested in switching some certs to Amazon Certificate Manager.
To do that we need to add the ACM CAs.
