encoding/json: U+2028 and U+2029 generate invalid JavaScript


The basic problem is that U+2028 and U+2029 are invalid in a JavaScript string literal,
which means you must encode them as the six-character literals like "\u2028"
when generating JSON.  This post discusses further how JSON is not a subset of
JavaScript:

This code snippet demonstrates the problem.  When I paste the printed snippet into
Chrome's JavaScript console I get an invalid token error.

PS: it's not really's Go's problem that the (valid) JSON it generates is not parseable
as JavaScript.  But encoding/json already does some not-required-by-JSON encoding (the
way it HTML-escaping angle brackets), so it seems silly to not encode these rare
characters as well; might as well do them as part of HTML-escaping.
