[RFC] env processor language


Description
While reading the blog post about the nice addition of the url and query_string env processor, I have spotted that the syntax was quite hard to read. There is two main issues IMHO:

The processors are wrote and chained from left-to-right while read by the user from right-to-left. %env(key:user:url:MONGODB_URL)% is written as "fetch the key named user from the parsed url of the env var named MONGODB_URL" while it seems easier to reason about it in the other direction.
Some processors accepts parameters but uses the same lexeme to separate the processor name from the argument list as the one used to chain processors (:). Using both like %env(key:user:url:MONGODB_URL)% is ambiguous and requires a good understanding of every env processors to be read.

I propose to change this syntax to the following: %env(MONGODB_URL|url|key:user)% where the pipe char (|) is used to chain env processors (turning them into filters) and the colon char (:) to list and separate arguments.
Example
# before
mongo_db_bundle:
    clients:
        default:
            username: '%env(key:user:url:MONGODB_URL)%'
            connectTimeoutMS: '%env(int:key:timeout:query_string:MONGODB_URL)%'
# after
mongo_db_bundle:
    clients:
        default:
            username: '%env(MONGODB_URL|url|key:user)%'
            connectTimeoutMS: '%env(MONGODB_URL|query_string|key:timeout|int%'
WDYT?
