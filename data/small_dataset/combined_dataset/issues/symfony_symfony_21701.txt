While creating a custom voter as per these instructions I'm getting the following error when trying to inject the decision manager service:
with public in the service declaration: true

Circular reference detected for service "security.access.decision_manager", path: "security.access.decision_manager".

with public in the service declaration: false

Circular reference detected for service "security.access.decision_manager", path: "cache_warmer -> twig -> security.authorization_checker -> security.access.decision_manager".

according to the docs, this should only not work < 2.8?  However, when I then tried injecting the container, and pull out the authorization.checker service inside the voter, and I get a similar circular reference error, even though the docs say this is the workaround.
So, I'm not sure if the docs are wrong, I've missed something, or this is a bug?
service declaration
app.form_config.voter:
        class: AppBundle\Services\voters\ConfigAccessVoter
        arguments: ["@security.access.decision_manager"]
        tags:
            - { name: security.voter }
        public: false
