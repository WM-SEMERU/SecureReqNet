Browser pin lock overlay


Test plan
1. Enable browser pin on 1.5 build
2. Background the app
3. Bring app to focus, ensure it asks for pin to unlock the app



Unlocking Brave

When the brave app has BrowserLock enabled any browser open, from a closed state, or from a background state will require pin-input. If fingerprint unlocking is also enabled the fingerprint dialog will appear before the pin input control.
The heavily blurred background will be an effect added when the browser enters a background state.

Cover behavior

Display privacy (browser-lock) cover when opening app from a closed or background state.
Display privacy cover when pushing app to background (double tap home button on device)
