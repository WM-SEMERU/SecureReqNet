Hi,
We are using a custom Role entity that's implementing the RoleInterface, but when we tried to apply ACL on the application, some SecurityContext->isGranted calls were denying access when they should actually allow.
After checking database, our code, Symfony code, we got to the dead end where the following triple comparison was returning false:
$this->role === $sid->getRole()

One $this->role was holding our custom object that implements the RoleInterface the other $sid->getRole() was holding a string, the strict comparison would obviously fail.
After updating the constructor and tests, everything looks great.
Thanks,
