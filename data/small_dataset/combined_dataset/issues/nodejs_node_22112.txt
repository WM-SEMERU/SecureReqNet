process: initial impl of feature access control


Just playing around with something here … this doesn’t need to happen, or can happen in a completely different way or by somebody else. I’d love to get ideas and feedback on this, though.

Implement process.accessControl, a simple API for restricting usage of certain in-process APIs,
and similarly an accessControl option when setting up workers.
