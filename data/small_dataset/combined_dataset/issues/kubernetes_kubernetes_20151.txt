make it possible to unmount secrets


Many applications have a setup phase where they need credentials and don't afterwards. It would be great not to retain the secrets in case of an application vulnerability.
It might also be nice to do that automatically (e.g. after a readiness probe succeeds). I think it ought to be an attribute of the container's volume mount (and not the volume).
