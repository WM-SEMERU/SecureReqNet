### Summary

When uploading an image (project wiki, issue, MR, ...) it get's stored as e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/uploads/6cf077c1d2954c8af1e890fb25b6accd/images.png. Because of the hash used in the URL the location of the image is not easily predictable but once someone got access to such a link, it can be accessed without any authentication.

This is especially problematic as an uploaded image can't be deleted by the user so once someone has the URL, it's impossible to deny access to an image. As an example, a former employee can still access uploaded images for internal projects even if his access has been disabled.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Upload an image somewhere in Gitlab (see test image below)
1. Copy the generated URL of the image
1. Logout of Gitlab
1. Access the image URL
1. See the image without the need of being authenticated

![images](/uploads/6cf077c1d2954c8af1e890fb25b6accd/images.png)

### Expected behavior

Access to images should only be granted if a user is authenticated and has permissions to view the part where an image was included. As this might be very complicated (an image could be referenced from multiple locations) at least it should be checked, if a user has at least _Guest_ permissions in the project where the image was uploaded.

### Actual behavior

See summary.

### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

### Possible fixes

See _Expected behavior_.
