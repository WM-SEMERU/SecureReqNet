improve insecure (HTTP) site UI


follow-up to #2178, we should make it more clear when sites are insecure and what to do in that case.

 show insecure icon in title mode. #3651
 change the urlbar icon from a yellow triangle (which collides with FIrefox's mixed content UI) to a red unlocked icon
 change the siteInfo popup to explain what 'insecure' means
