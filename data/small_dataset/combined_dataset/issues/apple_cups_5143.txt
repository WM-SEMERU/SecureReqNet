Remote DoS attack against cupsd via invalid username and malicious D-Bus library


Any user who can submit a print job to a CUPS server
can abort the cupsd running on the CUPS server by
submitting a job as a user with an invalid username.
I tested it with CUPS 1.7.5 and also the newest 2.2.5
so that I assume the issue is old and not fixed.
I think this issue here has the same root cause as
#4748
As far as I see the fix there belongs to the LPD mini daemon
but this issue here belongs to the cupsd.
How to reproduce:
On a (Linux) client system create a user with an
invalid username - I use 'binär' as username that has
the character ä (Latin small letter a with diaeresis,
i.e. the German a-umlaut) encoded in  ISO-8859-1
encoding so that the username in hex byte values is
62 69 6e e4 72

Usually one cannot create such a username with "useradd"
(because it rejects invalid usernames) so that one must
manually edit /etc/passwd.
Then as this user submit a print job from the client system
to a (possibly remote) CUPS server.
The cupsd on the CUPS server will bet aborted
inside a D-Bus library call that sends SIGABRT
which aborts the whole caller process.
In /var/log/messages or nowadays in the "journalctl" output
one gets things like
