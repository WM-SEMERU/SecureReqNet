On-demand de-provisioning.


@wsanchez originally submitted this as ticket:111

Principal and calendar home resources need to be de-provisioned somehow. See #‚Å†25 for how I expect it to work, based on the directory service.
What's presently missing is handling the case where a disabled user is re-enabled with a new GUID (meaning it's a new user with the same short name). Right now, the new user sees the old user's data.
Moving to 2.x for the rest.
