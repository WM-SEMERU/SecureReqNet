OnSignedIn event regardless of the authentication used


Is there a way to register a delegate to be called on successful login regardless of the authentication method used (Identity, AzureAD, etc), and not on every request, similar to this one?
Right now I'm using ClaimsTransformationMiddleware, but it's called on every request.
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
    services.AddSingleton<IClaimsTransformation, EveryoneGroupTransformer>();
    ...
}
...

public class EveryoneGroupTransformer : IClaimsTransformation
{
    public Task<ClaimsPrincipal> TransformAsync(ClaimsPrincipal principal)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(principal.Identity.Name);
        return Task.FromResult(principal);
    }
}
