'### Summary
 
**This bug happens on GitLab.com**
 
Failed 2-factor logins where the password is correctly entered but the second factor is not valid do not show up in the user-accessible audit log available at
 https://gitlab.com/profile/audit_log  
 
They should appear because this means a possible security warning is not flagged for an user to inspect - someone knows the account password but doesn't have access to the second factor. This happens for both the traditional Authenticator App as second factor and for FIDO U2F authentication.
 
i tried on purpose to login with the correct password but to fail the 2-factor login on my account with both a randomly entered code and an unregistered Yubikey and neither of these failures caused an event to appear in the audit log.
 
### Steps to reproduce
- try to login with a 2-factor enabled account.
- enter the password correctly but enter random incorrect numbers in the App code field or use a U2F key that's not associated with the account.
 
### Expected behavior
i'd expect to see a failed login event in the audit log that says the password was correct but the second factor was not.
 
### Actual behavior
no failed login events appear in the audit log
 
### Possible fixes
show failed logins in the audit log when the password was correctly entered but the second factor was not correct.
