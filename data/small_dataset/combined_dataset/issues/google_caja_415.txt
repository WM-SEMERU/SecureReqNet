asSimpleFunc() shouldn't allow attached methods.


Original issue 415 created by erights on 2008-06-09T01:08:39.000Z:
If foo is an attached method, asSimpleFunc(foo) will return foo rather than
failing. This cannot cause the attached method to be successfully called
when it shouldn't be, but it violates the notion of a simple-function. An
attached method can still sense and react to its "this" binding, which a
simple-function shouldn't be able to do.
