Current ObjectNormalizer was not using the object class resolver when extracting attributes, i found this when trying to refactor api platform normalizers and dealing with doctrine proxy objet having initialize property not wanted cf api-platform/core#2579
I don't think this is BC break, but maybe some people using this object class resolver can get different behavior ?
