class_alias not working


Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4.x & php 7.3
Description
Upgrading symfony from 2.8 to 3.4 it ocurs:
Compile Error: Declaration of Assetic\Extension\Twig\AsseticNode::compile(Twig_Compiler $compiler) must be compatible with T
wig\Node\Node::compile(Twig\Compiler $compiler)
I think that it is about class_alias in twig
How to reproduce
You need upgrade to Symfony 3.4
Possible Solution
If add class_alias from twig in app_dev.php it work
