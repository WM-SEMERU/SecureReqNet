Make external CA support more generic


The existing external CA support implies the use of the CFSSL protocol.
This change makes ExternalCAs a list of structs instead of strings. Each
struct specifies the type of the external CA (currently, only CFSSL is
supported). In the future we may add other items to this struct such as
options.
