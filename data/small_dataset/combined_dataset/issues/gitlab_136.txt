As all things git are focused around the sha it would be nice to see at least the first portion of the sha in front of the commit description. 

This can easily be done by modifying the line:
r.text(@offsetX + @unitSpace * @mspace + 35, y, commit.message.split("\n")[0]).attr(
to:
r.text(@offsetX + @unitSpace * @mspace + 35, y, commit.id.substring(0,7) + " " + commit.message.split("\n")[0]).attr(

in app/assets/javascripts/branch-graph.js.coffee around line 205.

Thanks!!
