After uploading the gitlab-6-6-5-centos-6-5-64bit.zip to our OpenStack infra and starting an instance, I was unable to connect to it. This turned out to be because the network interface was not properly configured. We removed the net rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules, then rebooted, but that wasn't sufficient. After that, we modified the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 and renamed it to eth1, ran ifup, then it started working.
