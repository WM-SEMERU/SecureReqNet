As long as you are only interested in authentication, adding behavior to the firewall works fine. But if you need your listener to be executed after the AnonymousAuthenticationListener, you're gonna get a cold shower.
What would be needed is new items in SecurityExtension::$listenerPositions for the listeners that are now added without using that (I counted 3 real quick), add all the listeners in a single loop. Then it would also be nice to allow NULL for the first value in the tuple returned by SecurityFactoryInterface::create(), I now have to work around that by using a provider that always returns FALSE when support() is invoked because it actually is interpreted as a service ID of "" (which could also be considered a bug).
I'll gladly cook up a PR if it has any chance of getting merged.
