Security Problem: Screenshot Function


Original issue 402 created by TriplexAccount.P.N on 2014-07-08T10:27:41.000Z:
Copied from google/google-authenticator#401 because it applies to Android app (as well?).
What steps will reproduce the problem?

Call Screenshot Function from the specific smartphone

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Google Authentificator: 2.49
Please provide any additional information below.
In general, it is not possible to take a screenshot of any inner user interface from a banking app for security reason. The Google Authentificator can be comprimised by using a trojan with screenshot function. Please disable the ability to take a screenshot from the main interface from the Google Authentificator.
