fastpath canSet test is inconsistent


Original issue 1052 created by felix8a on 2009-06-19T21:49:34.000Z:
in cajita.js, canSet checks that the grant is for
the object itself, not inherited:
if (obj[name + 'canSet__'] === obj) { return true; }
however, when you cajole something like this in cajita mode
function f(a) { a.x = 3; }
the fastpath test looks like
a.x_canSet___ ? (a.x = 3) : ___.setPub(a, "x", 3);
which can succeed if the grant is inherited.
this might lead to subtly different behavior in different
conditions, eg, with/without debugging.
it might also be exploitable, but I don't know of any
particular exploits.
