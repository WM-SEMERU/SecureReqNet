'If you would enable custom gravatars. And you want to use the 'email' parameter. Shouldn't that be URL encoded? I always thought that the @@-sign was prohibited in an url.

I'm asking this because we have an internal server with all the user photos that I would like to enable in our private server. But the firewall is configured to do strict URL checking, which doesn't accept the 'at-sign' in the url.

I think the url encoding should be done in this line, but I never used ruby, so I dont know how to url-encode in ruby.
