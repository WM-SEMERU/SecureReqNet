[Security] Change UserProviderInterface contract or add a new GuardUserProviderInterface


Description
When creating a custom User Provider, I faced the problem, that I would like to loadUserByUsername, not just by username, but by 1 more additional property. (ex: email and a "contractId"), as I have 3 field authentication (email password and a "contractId").
My first solution was to pass inside provider an array with email and the 'contractId'
ex:
<?php
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserProviderInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Guard\AuthenticatorInterface;

class CustomAuthenticator implements AuthenticatorInterface
{
    //    ...
    public function getCredentials(\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request $request)
    {
        return [
            'email' => 'qq@qq.com',
            'contractId' => 1
        ];
    }

    public function getUser($credentials, UserProviderInterface $userProvider)
    {
        $userProvider->loadUserByUsername($credentials);
    }

    //...
}
But in that case, the method name is not really reflecting what I am doing, and if in the future the Symfony will decide to change the definition to the loadUserByUsername(string $username), I will need to change my implementation.
The second solution was, to ignore the UserProvider at all, and to do the loading of the user in the method getUser() of my CustomAuthenticator.
ex:
<?php

use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserProviderInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Guard\AuthenticatorInterface;

class CustomAuthenticator implements AuthenticatorInterface
{
    //    ...
    public function getUser($credentials, UserProviderInterface $userProvider)
    {
        return new AuthUser(
            $credentials['email'],
            $credentials['contractId']
        );
    }
    //...
}
But i that case, i have defined a UserProvider, that I am not using, and with the Guards, it's mandatory to have one.
Proposoal
Does it make sense at all, to have a GuardUserProviderInterface, that will have a method loadUserByCriteria that will expect an array or one of solution above is ok ?
ex:
<?php

namespace Symfony\Component\Security\Guard\Provider;

interface GuardUserProviderInterface
{
    public function loadUserByCriteria(array $criteria);
    
    public function refreshUser(UserInterface $user);

    public function supportsClass($class);
}
