Description of change
This emits a warning first time SlowBuffer instance is created and instructs the users to switch to Buffer.alloc() or Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(), both of which are not pooled.
Refs: #8169
Refs: #7152
Not sure if we should do this in v7 or v8. It looks like SlowBuffer is used only by a small number of modules (I found 416, only 330 of which â€” outside of tests, and some of those are false positives). Module authors could use safe-buffer to polyfill for older Node.js versions, though.
Labelling as in progress because this lacks tests.
