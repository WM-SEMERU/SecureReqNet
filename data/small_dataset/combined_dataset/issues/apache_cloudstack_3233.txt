[WIP DO NOT MERGE] ui: don't ignore project when listing templates


Problem: When uploading template or iso in a project, the progress is not seen
Root Cause: When users upload a template/iso in project view, the template/iso is not visible in the all filter. This creates confusion that template/iso has not been uploaded.
Solution: Since the api listtemplates with a projectid acts is a superset of list templates without a project id, we should not ignore the project id when listing templates in all filter. This solves the reported issue by BT.
