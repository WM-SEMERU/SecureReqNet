Redirection loop after validate redirect targets - Logging in to a different domain





Q
A




Feature request?
yes


Symfony version
3.2.13 and never



After this change: 52b06f1#diff-76577aed100434c043a441fee636edad
I have a problem with redirection to a login page that is under a different domain.
Regex detects a different domain in login path and sets up a cookie domain redirection.
The result is a redirection loop.
The problem would be solved by adding a trusted domain for login page.
I understand that it increases security but in some situations it is a breaking change.
