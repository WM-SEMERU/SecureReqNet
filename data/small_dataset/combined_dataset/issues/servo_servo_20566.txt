Introduce imprecision in timers for timing attack mitigation


cc @asajeffrey
Servo can already run in multiprocess mode, but we need to think about:
a) how to keep SM up-to-date,
b) a security audit to make sure that sensitive data is in appropriate processes, and
c) what mitigations are needed even when running in multiprocess (e.g. process throttling).
See w3c/hr-time#56 for more discussion
Per discussion with Tom R:
Insecure clamping/jitter implementation in SpiderMonkey (off by
default): https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/jsdate.cpp#1308
How to set/enable it: JS::SetTimeResolutionUsec
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/jsdate.cpp#419
Good for testing; not good for security.
For 'production' use:
You'll want to duplicate
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/resistfingerprinting/nsRFPService.cpp#316
and
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/resistfingerprinting/nsRFPService.cpp#476
and
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/resistfingerprinting/nsRFPService.cpp#569
And then call
