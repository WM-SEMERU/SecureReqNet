feature switch user fail exit on 2.6.10 not on 2.6.9


Hello,
I use this nice feature.
Today, i update composer and i get symfony 2.6.10.
i use the default setting same the exemple on this page :
(http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/impersonating_user.html)
The feature work when i switch to a another user but when i try to switch out ( EXIT ), i'am automatically redirect on my login page and always logued with the another user.
I decrease symfony to 2.6.9 and the problem has disappeared.
So i can't upgrade my symfony version for now.
Thanks for your time
ps : i know... i need update to symfony 2.7.x ! ;)
