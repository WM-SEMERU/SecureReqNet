potential XSS Sink `loadScript`


loadScript allows creating a new script element and adding it to the DOM. The URL of the script is supplied from the caller and may point to the web.
This is used in the privileged index.js as well as the unprivileged main.js, but in any case, I would recommend allowing relative URLs only.
This can be achieved by something like this:
function loadScript(path)  {
    var parsedURL = new URL(path, location.href);
    if (parsedURL.origin !== location.origin) { return }
    // ...
