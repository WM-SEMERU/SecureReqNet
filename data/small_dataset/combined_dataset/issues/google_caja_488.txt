JS identifier length not limited (was Risk of too many spicy wunderbars)


Original issue 488 created by jasvir on 2008-06-11T01:02:58.000Z:
The length of identifiers is browser dependent.  If an identifier is too
long and does not generate a syntax error or gets truncated, it may be used
to prevent trailing underbars on a variable from being applied.
Caja should enforce a short identifier length.
