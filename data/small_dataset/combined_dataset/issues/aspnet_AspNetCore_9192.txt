old version doesn't work after install new version of Dotnet Core


Describe the bug
I've install the new version of .Net Core 2.2.202. But I have a project with .Net Core 2.0.

When I trid to build in Visual Studio 2017, it showed the following message:

Since I couldn't build the project with current 2.2.202. I uninstalled the SDK 2.2.202. But It still didn't work.
So how can I revert to the old environment or I can exchange the .Net Core SDK in Visual Studio 2017?
