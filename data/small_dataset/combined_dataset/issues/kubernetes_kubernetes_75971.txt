Correctly send list metadata with v1beta1 PartialObjectMetadataList


The ListMeta field was accidentally omitted. The v1 api version will change the
protobuf ID ordering to match other lists, but v1beta1 can't do that without being
backwards incompatible.
/kind bug
Resource list requests for PartialObjectMetadata now correctly return list metadata like the resourceVersion and the continue token.
