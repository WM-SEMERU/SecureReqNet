This is a work in progress and not quite ready for review ðŸ˜„
Fixes #189

 general formatting of numbers through d3-format
 locale format
 si prefix
 four digits grouping case
separate_4digits nested prop under locale will prevent grouping on values ]-10000,+10000[
 python helper methods
 proper documentation of the new props / nested props
 proper documentation / IDE integration (?) or discoverability of Python helpers
 push BI logic (column format defaults, etc.) higher in the stack (ideally in/around datatable.js)
BI logic here means (1) data validation and (2) data sanitizing -- more data sanitizing/validation can be added in the future, for now concerning itself with columns (new) & pagination/filtering/sorting (refactored)
 general / sanity unit testing of the formatter functionality
 integration testing of formatting / table content
 testing for Python wrappers
 changelog entry
 basic performance verifications
 toPlotlyJson for Format objects
 rename Python-facing currency to symbol

Edge cases identified while writing tests or documentation

 handling of coerce/validation/passthrough/isNully cases during formatting -- a number column may very well not contain a number, how to configure and handle these cases from a formatting perspective?
Approach: overridable nully behavior, non-number types are passthroughs
 Clipboard copy/paste behavior is ok when data comes from outside but does not deal well with null/undefined cases as everything gets transformed to a string ('' in those cases) and information is lost
Approach Keep a duplicate of the df slice copied -- if during paste the df slice's stringification is the same as the clipboard content, assume that the data came from a datatable.
 determine desired nully case behavior (currently '' (empty string)

Note: Diff settings -> Hide whitespace helps with a few of the diffs that involve indentation changes..
