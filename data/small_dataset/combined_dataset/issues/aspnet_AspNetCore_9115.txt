Disable SameSite for AzureAd and B2C cookies


RE: #4647
We've disabled SameSite for many OAuth/OIDC scenarios, but we haven't done it for the cookies added by AddAzureAd and AddAzureAdB2C.
The workaround for these scenarios is not discoverable:
services.Configure<CookieAuthenticationOptions>(AzureADDefaults.CookieScheme, options =>
{
  options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;
});

The fix would go here:



AspNetCore/src/Azure/AzureAD/Authentication.AzureAD.UI/src/AzureADCookieOptionsConfiguration.cs


         Line 31
      in
      258d34e






 options.AccessDeniedPath = "/AzureAD/Account/AccessDenied";
