Server-Side Blazor logging should be at Debug


info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.Circuits.RemoteUriHelper[0]
      RemoteUriHelper initialized.
info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.ComponentHub[0]
      Received confirmation for batch 2.

This kind of info should be logged at the debug level instead of info. There's a high bar for justification for logging that takes place at info.
