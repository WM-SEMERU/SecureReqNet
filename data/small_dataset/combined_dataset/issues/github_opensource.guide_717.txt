[Security] Bump nokogiri from 1.8.4 to 1.8.5


Bumps nokogiri from 1.8.4 to 1.8.5. This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The Ruby Advisory Database.

Nokogiri gem, via libxml2, is affected by multiple vulnerabilities
Nokogiri 1.8.5 has been released.
This is a security and bugfix release. It addresses two CVEs in upstream
libxml2 rated as "medium" by Red Hat, for which details are below.
If you're using your distro's system libraries, rather than Nokogiri's
vendored libraries, there's no security need to upgrade at this time,
though you may want to check with your distro whether they've patched this
(Canonical has patched Ubuntu packages). Note that these patches are not
yet (as of 2018-10-04) in an upstream release of libxml2.
Full details about the security update are available in Github Issue #1785.
[#1785]: https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1785

[MRI] Pulled in upstream patches from libxml2 that address CVE-2018-14404
and CVE-2018-14567. Full details are available in #1785. Note that these
patches are not yet (as of 2018-10-04) in an upstream release of libxml2.

Patched versions: >= 1.8.5
Unaffected versions: none
