The Browser Frezzed


Hi, when I was looking this site http://www.tvseriesdk.com/reto-4-elementos-2-capitulo-34/
the browser let to see all the Video, but when I want to close it, don't let me do it with the "X" at the Upper Right of the window. Other thing is that if I Want to see the Larger image of the Video the Browser bar don't desappear as the others browsers.
