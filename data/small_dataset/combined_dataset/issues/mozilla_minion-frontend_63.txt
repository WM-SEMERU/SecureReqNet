User is capable of accessing api after logout


Problem
When a user logs out of the system by clicking "logout", the user can still make contact with the frontend api, requesting all the information the user has access to.
This is because we don't call /api/logout when we called the logout function.
Currently, flask stores the session information in the cookie file. So we should at least clear the session record in the frontend. We can address the cookie issue later.
