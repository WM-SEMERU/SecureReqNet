Status Code, 200


I would like to ask if there is any chance to send a 200 instead of 404 status code. Thanks in advance.
Background: I am working on Apple pay with wordpress and stripe, which i have to verify my domain. After spending 9 hours working on htaccess, i have came to your plugin. and got no luck with another hour trying to force it to send back 200.
