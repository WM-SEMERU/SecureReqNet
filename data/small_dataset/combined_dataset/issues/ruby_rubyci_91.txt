[Security] Bump rails from 5.2.2 to 5.2.2.1


Bumps rails from 5.2.2 to 5.2.2.1. This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Critical severity vulnerability that affects actionview
Denial of Service Vulnerability in Action View
Impact
Specially crafted accept headers can cause the Action View template location
code to consume 100% CPU, causing the server unable to process requests.  This
impacts all Rails applications that render views.
All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.
Releases
The 6.0.0.beta3, 5.2.2.1, 5.1.6.2, 5.0.7.2, and 4.2.11.1 releases are
available at the normal locations.
Workarounds
This vulnerability can be mitigated by wrapping render calls with
respond_to blocks.  For example, the following example is vulnerable:

Affected versions: >= 5.2.0, <= 5.2.2

High severity vulnerability that affects actionview
File Content Disclosure in Action View
Impact
There is a possible file content disclosure vulnerability in Action View.
Specially crafted accept headers in combination with calls to render file:
can cause arbitrary files on the target server to be rendered, disclosing the
file contents.
The impact is limited to calls to render which render file contents without
a specified accept format.  Impacted code in a controller looks something like
this:
class UserController < ApplicationController 
  def index 
    render file: "#{Rails.root}/some/file" 
  end 
end 

 ... (truncated)
Affected versions: >= 5.2.0, <= 5.2.2

Moderate severity vulnerability that affects railties
Possible Remote Code Execution Exploit in Rails Development Mode
Impact
With some knowledge of a target application it is possible for an attacker to
guess the automatically generated development mode secret token.  This secret
token can be used in combination with other Rails internals to escalate to a
remote code execution exploit.
All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.
Releases
The 6.0.0.beta3 and 5.2.2.1 releases are available at the normal locations.
Workarounds
This issue can be mitigated by specifying a secret key in development mode.
In "config/environments/development.rb" add this:
 ... (truncated)
Affected versions: >= 5.2.0, <= 5.2.2
