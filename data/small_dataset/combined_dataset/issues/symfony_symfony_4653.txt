[SecurityBundle] BadCredentialsException when bad password provided


Helo
I think it will be good to add User object as extraInforamtion to this exception when bad pasword was sent, like it is in other exceptions thrown by Authentication system.
It is usefull when you want save login falure reason in AuthenticationFailureHandler
Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authentication\Provider\DaoAuthenticationProvider line 67
And option of hiding this exception for user (like it is with UserNotFoundException) is good idea because we don't give information about user existence - simple text "bad username or password" is enough in both cases
