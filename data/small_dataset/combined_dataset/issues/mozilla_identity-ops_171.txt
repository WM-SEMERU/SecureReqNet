Deploy Persona Gmail Bridge 0.9.9 or 0.9.10 to Stage


Hey @relud,
A persona-gmail-bridge update is available that moves us to Node 0.10, fixes a user-visible error during authentication, and upgrades all of the dependencies to their latest (Express 4, etc.)
Please deploy one of the following tags to stage:

0.9.9: mozilla/persona-gmail-bridge@3a3a1ac
0.9.10: mozilla/persona-gmail-bridge@a50ea65

The only difference is that 0.9.10 renames everything from sideshow or browserid-bridge-gmail to persona-gmail-bridge, which will require a bunch updates to the Chef scripts in this repo. The RPM prefix, package name, and many file paths changed.
If going through those changes aren't awesome for you right now, then I'm totally happy with 0.9.9.
