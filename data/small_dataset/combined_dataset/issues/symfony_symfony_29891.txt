Improve the way exceptions are listed in the error page


Description
The order in which multiple exceptions are displayed in the error page is sometimes confusing.
Example
If you make a mistake in the config/services.yaml file of the Symfony Demo app, you see this:

There is a perfect exception message that tells you exactly what happened ... but it's "buried" so low, that you probably won't see it.
If we reverse the order of exceptions in this case, the error page would be much better.
The above has happened to me several times with different errors ... but the opposite too: sometimes the current order is the best order. So:

Should we reverse the order of exceptions in the error page in all cases?
Is this a matter of tweaking some but not all exceptions?

Thanks!
