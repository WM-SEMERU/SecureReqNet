Error when play video at brighteon.com

Can not play video at brighteon.com with default settings. I got this error:
An unanticipated problem was encountered, check back soon and try again
Error Code: MEDIA_ERR_UNKNOWN

I have to turn off shields then it can play without problem. The video is hosted at Brightcove.com. Please help to look into this issue.
Thank you,
