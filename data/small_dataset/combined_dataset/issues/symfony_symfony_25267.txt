... which means that the value defined on last firewall will be global. The problem comes from here:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.4/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DependencyInjection/SecurityExtension.php#L260
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.4/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DependencyInjection/SecurityExtension.php#L274
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.4/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DependencyInjection/SecurityExtension.php#L283

The problem is that while the option is under each firewall in configuration in fact it's applied to global context listener. This gets even more confusing when looking at deprecation message:

Not setting "logout_on_user_change" to true on firewall "xyz" is deprecated as of 3.4, it will always be true in 4.0.

Consider the following example:
security:
    firewalls:
        fw1:
            logout_on_user_change: true
        fw2:
            logout_on_user_change: false # Or omitted
End result - old, depreciated behaviour everywhere. The resulting container:
$this->services['security.context_listener.0'] = $instance = new \Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\ContextListener(...);

$instance->setLogoutOnUserChange(true);
$instance->setLogoutOnUserChange(false);

return $instance;
