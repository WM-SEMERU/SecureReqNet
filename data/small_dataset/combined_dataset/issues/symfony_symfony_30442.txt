See #30432 for more details:

Symfony version(s) affected: 3.4, maybe other versions too (not tested)
Description
Error message when allowedTypes is an array contains [] but should not:
The option "testme" with value array is expected to be of type "string[]", but one of the elements is of type "integer[]".
It should be:
The option "testme" with value array is expected to be of type "string[]", but one of the elements is of type "integer".
How to reproduce
$resolver = (new OptionsResolver())
    ->setDefault('testme', [])
    ->setAllowedTypes('testme', ['string[]'])
    ->resolve(['testme' => ['test', 12]]);


In addition I changed an error message to be more
accurate if provided more than one incorrect value:

[...] is expected to be of type "integer[][]", but is of type "integer|boolean|string".
