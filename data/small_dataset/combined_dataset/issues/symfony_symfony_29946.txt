[Security][BUG] Security final class can not be mocked in unit tests


Symfony version(s) affected: v4.1.9
Description
When writing unit tests on classes that use Security as dependency get the "Class "Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Security" is declared "final" and cannot be mocked." warning.
How to reproduce
class A
{
    /** @var Security */
    private $security;

    public function __construct(Security $security)
    {
        $this->security = $security;
    }
}

class ATest
{
    /** @var Security|ObjectProphecy */
    private $security;

    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->security = $this->prophesize(Security::class);
    }
}

Run the test.
Possible Solution
Remove final? Or somehow when mocking the class mark the original class as not final.
