*ViaThis rules should be after *BadInternal rules


Original issue 286 created by erights on 2008-05-17T23:34:24.000Z:
<script>
this.freeze_;
</script>
should be rejected, since the "this" refers to IMPORTS___'s public
interface. Instead it cajoles to
<script type="text/javascript">{
_.loadModule(function (, IMPORTS__) {
{
caja.result(IMPORTS___.freeze__canRead___?
IMPORTS___.freeze_: _.readPub(IMPORTS, 'freeze'));
}
});
}</script>
which is at least harmless in this case, since freeze_ is not canRead.
However, if IMPORTS___ has protected data members, they will be exposed.
Similarly,
<script>
this.freeze_();
</script>
cajoles to
<script type="text/javascript">{
_.loadModule(function (, IMPORTS__) {
{
caja.result((undefined, IMPORTS___.freeze__canCall___?
IMPORTS___.freeze_(): _.callPub(IMPORTS, 'freeze', [ ])));
}
});
}</script>
which is not harmless.
