build(deps): [security] bump static-eval from 2.0.0 to 2.0.2


Bumps static-eval from 2.0.0 to 2.0.2. This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The npm Advisory Database.

Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution
Versions of static-evalprior to 2.0.2 pass untrusted user input directly to the global function constructor, resulting in an arbitrary code execution vulnerability when user input is parsed via the package.
Proof of concept
var evaluate = require('static-eval');
var parse = require('esprima').parse;

var src = process.argv[2];
var payload = '(function({x}){return x.constructor})({x:"".sub})("console.log(process.env)")()'
var ast = parse(payload).body[0].expression;
console.log(evaluate(ast, {x:1}));

Affected versions: <=2.0.1
