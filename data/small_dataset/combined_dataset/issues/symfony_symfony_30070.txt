Silence symfony framework deprecation


Description
Symfony Framework internal vendors deprecation are shown in logs, even you do not have to deal with them for many reasons :

They are gone when you upgrade
You do not have to modify them
Having that in mind, they are just polluting logs.

This issue is about silencing them in Symfony Apps and ONLY symfony apps. People using component still have to receive these deprecations.
They could be safely silenced (maybe not?) using @ silent operator ?
Example
User Deprecated: Passing a "Symfony\Component\Translation\MessageSelector" instance into 
the "Symfony\Component\Translation\Translator::__construct" as a second 
argument is deprecated since Symfony 3.4 and will be removed in 4.0.  
Inject a "Symfony\Component\Translation\Formatter\MessageFormatterInterface" implementation instead.
