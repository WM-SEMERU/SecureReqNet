Finish saving test results on failure


The conformance image should be saving its results
regardless of the results of the tests. However,
with errexit set, when ginkgo gets test failures
it exits 1 which prevents saving the results
for Sonobuoy to pick up.
Fixes: #76036
/kind bug
Special notes for your reviewer:
Currently working on building this image and testing it works as expected.
Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?:
Ensures the conformance test image saves results before exiting when ginkgo returns non-zero value.
