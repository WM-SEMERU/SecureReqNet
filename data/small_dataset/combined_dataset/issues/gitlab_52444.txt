**[HackerOne report #421305](https://hackerone.com/reports/421305)** by ngalog on 2018-10-09:

**Summary:** 
Private namespace and confidentials issue's title should be protected from unauthorised user, however it could be leaked by cross linking issues from commit messages.


##PoC
Visit https://gitlab.com/golduserngalog/securitything/commits/master 
When you hover the cursor to newpathhereds/testproject#1 , you will see `create some file please` on the screen

The private name space `newpathhereds/testproject#1` and title of the confidential issue `create some file please` is leaked.

## Steps To Reproduce:
Create a commit, and in commit message paste a link of a confidential message inside a private project that you are authorised to view

Now visit the commit page like `https://gitlab.com/:project_namespace/commits/master `, now you will be able to see the title of the confidential issue and the private namespace of the project.
