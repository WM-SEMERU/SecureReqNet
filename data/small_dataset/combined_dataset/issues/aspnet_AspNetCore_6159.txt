Authentication not work on netcoreapp2.2 http site


Hi,
Describe the bug
If I new a mvc site when individual authentication base on netcoreapp2.2 and disable UseHttpsRedirection, then user can't login in http site (http://localhost:5000) but https site(https://localhost:5001).
Is this a bug, or something more I need to do for http site?
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Using this version of ASP.NET Core 'netcoreapp2.2'
dotnet new mvc--no-https -au Individual
mark following code:

            //app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseStaticFiles();
            //app.UseCookiePolicy();

access http://localhost:5000, regist and login

Expected behavior
User can login on http site.
Thanks:)
