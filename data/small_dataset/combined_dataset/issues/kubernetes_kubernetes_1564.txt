Enforce namespace unique constraints


This is the update to actually enable namespace support.
At the moment, I pass a namespace as a query parameter in order to support namespace scoping on the v1beta urls.  Once v1beta3 lands, I will modify to pass namespace in the path.  Note the client libraries were modified to make this easy to do, so should be a trivial change once ready.
I broke the commits into logical sections to improve readability.
