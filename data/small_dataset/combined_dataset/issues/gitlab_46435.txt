'### Summary

Looking at a user profile on our own gitlab instance, the activity feed shows names of internal repositories, even when logged out.
Is there any previous discussion on this? Could this be made so either names or activity entries are not shown depending on login/permission status?

### Steps to reproduce

- When not logged in, go to a user profile
- Select Activity tab (default)

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Entries with names of (joined) internal repositories are shown.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Entries with names of internal repos are not shown, or names are anonymized, depending on user permissions.
