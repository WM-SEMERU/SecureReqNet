kubectl wait  add ability to show tail logs while waiting to a pod


What would you like to be added:
add the ability to show tail logs while waiting to a pod
something like:
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --selector=app=mongodb --timeout=300s pods --logs

Why is this needed:
Today instead of develop 3 commands:
loop:

get pod status
get logs of the pod
if complete or failed exit loop otherwise wait

I'm using the kubectl wait that solved for me section 1 and 2
please add the ability --logs
