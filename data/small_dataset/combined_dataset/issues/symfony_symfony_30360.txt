If #30359 is indeed considered as bug or problem, this PR is a solution to solve it.
TwigBundle default overriden bundle paths are defined too early in the bundle definition process. They are now configured in a CompilerPass that allows 3rd party bundles to override any Twig namespace and let the user have its own project overrides.
According to @yceruto request, I also moved the user-configured paths to the compiler pass.
