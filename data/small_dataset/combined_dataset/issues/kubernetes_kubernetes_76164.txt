Endpoints object got deleted after cluster upgrade


What happened:
I am using selectorless service to integrate my external glusterfs with Kubernetes. I only create the endpoint object without service object because that all what glusterfs needs. I upgraded my cluster through a process that involves cycling master nodes. Unexpectedly, the glusterfs endpoints object got deleted after cluster upgrade/update.
Since this causes my application down after the period of endpoint got deleted, is this expected behavior of Kubernetes?

What you expected to happen:
Endpoint stays after cluster upgrade/update even when corresponding service object is missing.
How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Easy reproduce. Create an endpoint:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: glusterfs-cluster
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 192.168.122.221
    ports:
      - port: 1
  - addresses:
      - ip: 192.168.122.222
    ports:
      - port: 1

Upgrade the cluster. Then the endpoint is gone.
Anything else we need to know?:
I find this endpoint_controller has this behavior that it only stays with service object present, but got delete if service object is missing. Could we do better that this? Or why not?
