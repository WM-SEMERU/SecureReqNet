XSS issue on Welcome page


Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!

 I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if any
 I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset
 I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar

Superset version
I am using old Caravel 0.10.0
Expected results
I have created one dashboard with this name "test<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>" .
When opening the welcome page, expected output is to be able to view the dashboard name.
Actual results
But instead of only viewing it, the alert() is getting triggered.
Steps to reproduce
Created a dashboard with "test<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>" .
Go back to Welcome page.
