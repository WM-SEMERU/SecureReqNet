Configure Docker to run with User Namespaces


This is feature request.
There are various attacks possible on Docker and K8s environments. One such category of attacks is related to Linux kernel resource sharing scheme and namespaces.
User Namespaces greatly improve Docker and K8s deployment security mapping 'host' PID to a  different 'container' PID. In other words when User Namespaces are in play process PIDs executed within Docker runtime never overlap with Linux host PIDs providing expected separation.

Enabling user namespaces on Ubuntu 16.04:


Create PID mapping:
adduser dockremap
echo dockremap:500000:65536 > /etc/subuid
echo dockremap:500000:65536 > /etc/subgid


Override default Docker startup options:
cat << 'EOF' >> /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/userns-remap.conf
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --userns-remap=default -H fd:// $DOCKER_OPTS
EOF


Restart Docker daemon:
systemctl restart docker.service


Verify that mapping is being applied:
ps xauw | grep dockerd


Environment:
Ubuntu 16.04
