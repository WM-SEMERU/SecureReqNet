is it worth mentioning?



Count and Length constraints allow to pass the exact value as the constructor argument when used in code.
new Length(5);
// is same as
new Length(['min' => 5, 'max' => 5]);
At the same time when using them as annotations, @Assert\Length(5) throws The options "" do not exist in constraint Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Constraints\\Length (fix for ugly exception is proposed in #30737). This happens because annotation's default value is passed as value. Since Length does not have a default option, value is replaced with ''.
This PR fixes this inconsistency.
