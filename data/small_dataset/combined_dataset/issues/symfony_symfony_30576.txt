Locking doesn't work right now, because of this missing return statement.
I can't provide a useful test case, because this is effective only when race conditions happen...
Writing the value should happen within the boundaries of the lock.
The final keyword is really missing, there are zero reasons to extend this class, adding it asap will make it clear and will unlock progress on this class.
Lastly, a type-hint fix is shipped here also.
