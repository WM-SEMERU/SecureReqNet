Login attempts Administrator Warning!


Hi,
How can we Administrators of ERPNext know that a user has tried more than 3/5 times to login and did not succeeded?
By checking the Authentication Log but why does not the system informs the Admin of the wrong attempts and lock the account for XXXX amount of time.
This should be a security concern.
