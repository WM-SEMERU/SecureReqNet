Auto-contribute fails to contribute anything due to non-signed up creators


Description
I have a lot of BATs which are queued up to be given to creators who haven't signed up yet, more than my balance.

Most of these will never get paid so it's surprising to me that this is blocking the auto-contribute to registered publishers. Once a month, I get a message saying that auto-contribute failed and that I need to top-up my Uphold account.
Since I have set my auto-contribute amount to 20 BAT / month:

which is well within my current Uphold balance, it seems like failing to auto-contribute is not the optimal way to handle this, presumably common, case.
At the very least, some BATs should be sent to the registered publishers who got my attention in the last month.
