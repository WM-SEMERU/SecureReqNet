google.visualization API taming failures

Running the manual tests in
http://localhost:8000/ant-testlib/com/google/caja/apitaming/tests-index.html?testsList=visualization-list.json&amp;cajaServer=/caja
shows several common failures; my notes on everything not apparently OK:
annotatedtimeline  "Cannot tame object as ctor"
charteditor        slightly different
chart-range-filter range grabbers don't work and layout is different
dashboard          is blank, "Cannot tame object as ctor"
datatable-test     is different, not sure of significance
drawchart          "Cannot tame object as ctor"
formatters         html cannot be used
formatters-table   both broken
gaugechart         "Cannot tame object as ctor"
geochart-markers   "Cannot tame object as ctor"
geochart-regions   "Cannot tame object as ctor"
geomap-markers     "Cannot tame object as ctor"
geomap-regions     "Cannot tame object as ctor"
intensitymap       "Cannot tame object as ctor"
motionchart        "Cannot tame object as ctor"
orgchart           "Cannot tame object as ctor"
table              "Cannot tame object as ctor"
treemap            "Cannot tame object as ctor"
This suggests there is a common problem which might be an easy fix.
