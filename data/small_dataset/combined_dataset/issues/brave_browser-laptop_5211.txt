only set frame title when navigation is not renderer initiated



 Submitted a ticket for my issue if one did not already exist.
 Used Github auto-closing keywords in the commit message.
 Added/updated tests for this change (for new code or code which already has tests).
 Ran git rebase -i to squash commits (if needed).

Test Plan:

go to http://web.mit.edu/zyan/Public/googlespoof.html
click on the link
when the new window stops loading, the tab title should be the tab URL instead of 'fake'

partial fix for #4973. this prevents the page-that-is-being-spoofed from displaying the title from the spoofing page.
