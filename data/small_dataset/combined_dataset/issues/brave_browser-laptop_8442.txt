Turning off shields and/or HTTPS Everywhere won't turn website to HTTP again


I found this issue while running manual tests for Linux
Version: v0.15.0-RC3
Platform: Ubuntu 16.04
STR:

Have shields and HTTPS Everywhere enabled
Go to http://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/public
Check that protocol is HTTPS
Turn off shields and/or HTTPS Everywhere
Refresh the page
Page is still indicating HTTPS
