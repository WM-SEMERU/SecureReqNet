What version of Go are you using (go version)?
go version go1.12 linux/amd64
Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
Yes.
What operating system and processor architecture are you using (go env)?
linux + amd64
What did you do?
Running the present tool with -orighost=present.example.localhost and the reverse proxy ensuring all connections are secure causes the "/socket" request origin to be mismatched.
What did you expect to see?
101 Switching Protocols
What did you see instead?
403 Forbidden
Workaround
If the origin url scheme is swapped out to "https", then the "/socket" request returns 101 as desired.
