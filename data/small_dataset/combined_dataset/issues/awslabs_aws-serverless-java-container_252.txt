Allow (or delegate to) other dispatcherServlets



Framework version: 1.3.1
Implementations: Spring Boot

Scenario
Use another servlet besides dispactherServlet.
Basically this issue is the same as #196  but was closed without a working solution. I want to deploy the same graphql-java SimpleGraphQLHttpServlet  which throws "Only dispatcherServlet is supported".
Expected behavior
It should somehow work :)
I already tried to register a ServletRegistrationBean but my compiler screams at me because the constructor of SimpleGraphQLServlet is private. is there any other way to get around this?
