dns: refactor internal/dns/promises.js


Use isIP() instead of isIPv4() since it does the additional
functionality that we were adding after our calls to isIP().
This not-so-incidentally also increases code coverage from tests. At
least one of the replaced ternaries was difficult to cover reliably
because operating system/configuration variances were too unpredictable.
Checklist
