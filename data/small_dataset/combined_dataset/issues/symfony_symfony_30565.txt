Create a very late controller argument value resolver to throw an intuitive error message when controller fails because it is not registered as a service.
I would like to resolve with the community the following questions:

Should this pull request target the 3.4 branch or the master branch because its kind of a new feature.
I don't like the name of the resolver ControllerNotRegisteredAsServiceValueResolver but couldn't come up with more proper name (its too long obviously). Can someone come up with shorter proper name for the resolver?
Is the exception message not too long too and is it clear enough what is the problem?

In the current state the pull request is ready to be merged only if everyone is okay with the name of the resolver and the message it provides.
