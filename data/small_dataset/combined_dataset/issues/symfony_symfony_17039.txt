BCryptPasswordEncoder's encodePassword throws BadCredentialsException


Is it correct to throw an AuthenticationException? It is thrown when the password to encode is too long.
Case: The user is trying to register a new username/password and the service is trying to encode the password for the user.
If the password is too long, the service will get an (unexpected) "AuthenticationException". Should it not be something like an InvalidArgumentException ?
