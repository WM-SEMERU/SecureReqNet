Add an option to temporarily disable mixed content protection


Currently we cannot access resource like flash video of mixed content site (ex. https://forgetfulbc.blogspot.com/2016/08/lastweek-t3.html) and it will be upgraded to https by https everywhere so downgrade to http for this site is not working.
Firefox and Chrome provide an option to disable the protection temporarily
