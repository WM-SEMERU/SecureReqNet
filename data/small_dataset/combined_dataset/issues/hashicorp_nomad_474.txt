Support for Consul KV


Perhaps this is already on the roadmap but it would nice to be able to use values from consul as metadata for a job as well as env variables this way configuration and such can be updated dynamically causing a restart of a job?
perhaps allowing for something like this in the env section:
env {
  MY_CONFIG_OPTION="{{consul "myapp/config/option"}}"
}

This would tell nomad to fill that env variable in with the value from the consul path given.
It would also be nice if after allocation it would watch that value for changes and restart the job accordingly.
Please let me know if you think this is a good idea or should I be composing tool on top of nomad (consul-template) to accomplish this.
