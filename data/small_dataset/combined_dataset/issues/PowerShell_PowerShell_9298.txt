Fixing test run crash by not passing script block to the callback


PR Summary
Fixing test run crash by not passing script block to the callback.
Updated the test. Also updated the XML documentation of those asynchronous APIs to call out this.
PR Context
When calling the asynchronous APIs on the PowerShell class, the passed in callback could be invoked on a thread without the default Runspace.
So if a delegate cast from script block is passed in, it would fail in such case.
