[Validator] File constraint always violated when uploading multiple files


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.2.3
Description
Ubuntu 18.04
PHP 7.2.15
When 'multiple' option is enabled and File constraint is set, validation always ends with ConstraintViolation.
How to reproduce
$uploadForm = $this->createFormBuilder()
        ->add('files', FileType::class, [
            'multiple' => true,
            'constraints' => [
                new File([
                    'mimeTypes' => 'application/pdf'
                ])
            ]
        ])
        ...

Following error message appears after submitting:

This value should be of type string
