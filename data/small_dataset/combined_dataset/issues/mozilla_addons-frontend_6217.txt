Using the back button allows you to operate the site as a signed out user


Describe the problem and steps to reproduce it:

Load AMO - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
Log in
Log out
Scroll down to the footer and follow a link that does not open in a new tab, such as Forum
Press the browser back button to return to AMO

What happened?
When returning to AMO you are fully signed in again. You can modify your profile, rate add-ons, and do whatever until you refresh the page -- at that point you are logged out.
What did you expect to happen?
When the user chooses to log out, they should really be logged out.
Anything else we should know?
