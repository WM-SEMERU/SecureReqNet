Update error/warning page communication and iconography


Description
Generally speaking we need to update the error page communication to omit mentions of the Chrome brand, chrome support links and chrome iconography across the board. This encompasses 60+ instances of communication between all the error page variations though the iconography specifically seems to fall specifically within these 6 icon groups:

Network Error pages - Sad document icon
SSL Errors - Red Triangle Alert Icon
Clock is ahead/behind - Clock icon
Loud Malware/Phishing pages - White Triangle Alert Icons (red background)
Captive Portal - Wifi symbol
No internet - Dinosaur

Additionally, the typographic and button styling should be updated to Brave brand parity. i.e. Poppins, Muli and rounded button aesthetic. This could also be a unique opportunity to introduce some brand personality and talk to users with a little more care and relatable verbiage since it directly relates to their security which is pretty central to Brave values.
Steps to Reproduce

Type "chrome://interstitials/" into the brave URL bar to view ssl, clock, loud security alert and captive portal error states.
Type "chrome://network-errors/" into the brave URL bar to view network error states.
Type "chrome://dino/" into the Brave URL bar to view the "no internet" state.

Actual result:

Expected result:
This is a proposed initial stylistic update to the iconography for these states.
