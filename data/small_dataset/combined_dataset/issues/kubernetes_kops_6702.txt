3. What cloud provider are you using?
AWS
4. What commands did you run?  What is the simplest way to reproduce this issue?
kops upgrade cluster --yes
kops update cluster --yes
kops rolling-update cluster --yes

5. What happened after the commands executed?
Masters did not come online and ready reliably after restart or on first start.  Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.
6. What did you expect to happen?
Masters come online without problems.
7. Please provide your cluster manifest. Execute
kops get --name my.example.com -o yaml to display your cluster manifest.
You may want to remove your cluster name and other sensitive information.

9. Anything else do we need to know?
After some poking around, the issue seems to be that kube-apiserver takes more than 30 seconds to fully start up, sometimes.  The livenessProbe is configured with a 15 seconds delay and 15 seconds timeout.  So, the kube-apiserver is marked for termination just before it actually starts up.  It gets a 30 second grace period before it is terminated by kubelet.
I am not quite sure whether it is normal for kube-apiserver to take >30s to start up, perhaps there's something wrong with my setup that is slowing that process down unreasonably.
However, if I ssh into the server and increase the timeouts on the livenessProbe for kube-apiserver to 60 for both instead of 15 the master comes online OK.
I guess my proposal here is to increase the default livenessProbe initialDelay (maybe to 60 seconds) or make it configurable.
