fix($sanitize): use appropriate inert document strategy for Firefox and Safari


Both Firefox and Safari are vulnerable to XSS if we use an inert document
created via document.implementation.createHTMLDocument().
Now we check for those vulnerabilities and then use a DOMParser or XHR
strategy if needed.
Thanks to @cure53 for the heads up on this issue.
