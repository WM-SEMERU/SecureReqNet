Respondent IDs are appearing as Institution IDs for 2017 Data Publication Search


Upon searching for an institution in the 2017 mLAR and disclosure report search, the results show "Respondent ID: " but the following number is the institution ID, not the respondent ID.
Example:
First State Bank's Respondent ID is 18301 and their institution ID is 524766

However, when searching for the bank in the disclosure report search for 2017, 524766 shows up as the respondent ID. 18301 is what should show.
