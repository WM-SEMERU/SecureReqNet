Access control on the explore page


I want to build dashboards for the users, but don't want them to send custom queries. If I take away their can_save and can_edit permission, they still can sent custom queries. So I want to prohibit the user from entering the pages like /caravel/explore/druid/3 . But if I take away their can_explore permission, they will be unable to see the slices on the dashboard. So this is what I am trying to add in view.py:
def explore(self, datasource_type, datasource_id):
    ...
    slice_custom_query_perm = self.appbuilder.sm.has_access(
        'can_custom_query', 'SliceModelView')

    if request.args.get("json") == "true":
        ...
    elif request.args.get("csv") == "true":
        ...
    else:
        if request.args.get("standalone") == "true":
            template = "caravel/standalone.html"
        else:
            if not slice_custom_query_perm:
                flash(_("You don't seem to have the permission "
                        "to customize the slices"), "danger")
                return redirect(error_redirect)

            template = "caravel/explore.html"

Do you think it is a good idea to design it this way? How can I create the new permission "can_custom_query" in caravel init? Thanks
