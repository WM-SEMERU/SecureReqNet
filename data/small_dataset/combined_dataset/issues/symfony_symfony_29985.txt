The autocomplete feature of the QuestionHelper uses fread which is not multibyte safe, resulting in broken display of such characters in the autocompletion. To fix this I check the ascii code number of the entered character. If it is greater than 127 the next byte is read too. The same logic applies when deleting characters.
