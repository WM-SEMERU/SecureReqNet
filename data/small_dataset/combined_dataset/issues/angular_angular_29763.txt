How to declare pipe at component level?


I got a pipe that is used only in one component. So I wanted to declare pipe at this component level. Something like this:
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-comp',
  templateUrl: './my-comp.component.html',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  declarations: [MyCustomPipe]
})
export class MyComponent {

}

However the Component annotation doesn't support declarations.
Is there anyway to achieve this? I know I can declare pipe in the module but then other components will be "notified" about it and it will break encapsulation.
