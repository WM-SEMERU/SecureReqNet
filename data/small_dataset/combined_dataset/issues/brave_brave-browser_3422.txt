Referrer spoofing could disable login CSRF protections on some sites


Some sites (e.g. anything using the default Django authentication system) use the Referer header in order to prevent CSRF attacks on their login pages.
By setting the Referer to be the destination's origin (for cross-origin requests), we are essentially making sure that these security checks always pass, therefore making them ineffective at preventing CSRF attacks.
@diracdeltas suggested changing the referrer-spoofing code to:

strip the referrer entirely on cross-origin navigation requests and iframe sub-resources,
continue to spoof the referrer on cross-origin sub-resource requests, and
continue to send the full referrer on all same-origin requests.
