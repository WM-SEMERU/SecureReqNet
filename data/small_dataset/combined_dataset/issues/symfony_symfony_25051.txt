Symfony version
^3.1



Until version 2.8 it was easy done by changing the security.access.decision_manager.class parameter.
Since version 3.0 the only way is to overwrite the AccessDecisionManager.
But since version 3.1 it's not possible anymore because of the DebugAccessDecisionManager renamed TraceableAccessDecisionManager in 3.3.
What make it impossible to overwrite is that in the constructor the properties are taken with Reflexion from Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\AccessDecisionManager instead of the real manager (witch eventual can extends this class).
