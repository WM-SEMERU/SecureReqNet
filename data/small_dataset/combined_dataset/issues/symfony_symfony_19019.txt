The log information is wrong if the user provider isn't reloaded from user provider.
My use case:
I have custom user provider, that doesn't refresh user every time. User object is refreshed from database every x seconds. If the object is not refreshed from database, the object from session is used and the log information about reloaded user from provider should not occur.
