[Mailer] Set ESMTP Socket Stream Timeout


Description
There isn't a way--that I could see--to set the SocketStream's timeout when using the ESMTP Transport.  Some mail servers have delays for spam prevention purposes and one of my clients Exchange servers requires a 30 second delay for any emails to an external address.  This causes it to timeout every time.
