Issue with isPasswordValid in BCryptPasswordEncoder


Symfony version(s) affected: 4.0.9
Description
The current version of symfony has an issue in the BCryptPasswordEncoder. When you use the following code to create a new user the user will be unable to login.
$user->setPassword($this->userPasswordEncoder->encodePassword($user, $user->getPassword()));
Where user is the User class from symfony.
IMPORTANT NOTICE The example stated here is wrong cause it access the BCryptPasswordEncoder directly. Actually it is accessed via UserPasswordEncoderInterface, see this comment for details.
How to reproduce
<?php

$encoder = new \Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\BCryptPasswordEncoder(30);
$password = 'test';

$user = new User(); // User class based on symfony security User class
$user->setSalt(uniqid());
$user->setPassword($encoder->encodePassword($user, $password));

if ($encoder->isPasswordValid($user->getPassword(), $password, $user->getSalt())) {
    echo 'Authenticated';
} else {
    echo 'Wrong username or password';
}
Possible Solution
Not actually meant as a solution, but when I reencode the password and compare them it works fine.
<?php

$encoder = new \Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\BCryptPasswordEncoder(30);
$password = 'test';

$user = new User(); // User class based on symfony security User class
$user->setSalt(uniqid());
$user->setPassword($encoder->encodePassword($user, $password));

if ($encoder->encodePassword($user, $password) === $user->getPassword()) {
    echo 'Authenticated';
} else {
    echo 'Wrong username or password';
}
Additional context
If it helps you can checkout the project I use the code in. See here the linked commit is the state of writing this issue.
