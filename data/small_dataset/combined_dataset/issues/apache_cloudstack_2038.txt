ipv6: Allow all ICMPv6 traffic if -1 is provided as a ICMP type


ip6tables no longer takes '--icmpv6-type any' as a argument.
To allow all ICMPv6 traffic with ip6tables it has to be invoked this way:
$ ip6tables -I i-2-14-VM -p icmpv6 -s ::/0 -j ACCEPT
All ICMPv6 traffic is now allow into the Instance.
