No documentation on where iptables entries are generated


File: network/iptables.md
I have issues with Docker generating a network that conflicts with a VPN network, even after changing the daemon to launch on a different network. I've tracked the issue to be with iptables entries; however, I could not find any documentation in this page that says where these entries are being set on start-up, thus requiring me to clear those entries manually before connecting to the VPN.
I'd be great if there was some sort of documentation listing which parts of Docker set iptables entries, and possibly, how to configure them.
