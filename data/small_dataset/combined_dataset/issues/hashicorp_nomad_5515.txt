allocs: Add nomad alloc signal command


This command will be used to send a signal to either a single task within
an allocation, or all of the tasks if  is omitted. If the sent
signal terminates the allocation, it will be treated as if the allocation
has crashed, rather than as if it was operator-terminated.
Signal validation is currently handled by the driver itself and nomad does
not attempt to restrict or validate them. There is future work to ensure
compatibility of drivers and portability of signal names.
