Deprecate this repository


Now that Brave for iOS version 1.7 (WKWebView) has been released, all future changes and releases will use the new codebase at https://github.com/brave/brave-ios.

 Mark this repository as officially deprecated. Update the read me to reflect this. Example:


This project is currently being deprecated and is being has been replaced by a new codebase. Please see brave-ios for our continued development work.
As of today, this is still the App Store version of Brave. High priority issues will continue to be fixed until Brave 2.0 replaces this repo on the App Store.


 Transfer or close all issues in this repository's issue tracker.
 Update the "Pinned repositories" at https://github.com/brave to show brave-ios instead of browser-ios.
