webkitSpeechRecognition disabled and no way of detection


Description
In our application, we use a Speech to Text Recognition. Depending on whether or not a service is available in a given browser, we'll go in the following order for the used service.

Web Speech API
Watson API
Google Speech

Web Speech API is available in Chrome, which makes it available in Brave. However, it is disabled in Brave from returning data results, and we have no way of telling which speech service to use.
We need a way of detecting whether the Browser is a Brave browser so we know to ignore the disabled API, or for the API to be removed since it is not functional.
Steps to Reproduce
        navigator.getUserMedia({ audio: true },
          (stream) => {
             let recognition = new Recognition()

             // API Options
             recognition.lang = 'en-US';
             recognition.maxAlternatives = 1
             recognition.interimResults = true;

             // Results callback
             recognition.onresult = (event) => console.log(event)

             recognition.start()
          }
