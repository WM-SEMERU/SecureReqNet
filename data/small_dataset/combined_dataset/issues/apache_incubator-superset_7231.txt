bugfix: control validation handling and related state / queries



Fixes a series of unexpected, really bad behaviors around control validation:

when a chart opens in a state where a control is invalid, it still
runs the query, and sometimes gets stuck in what appears to be a 'running'
state. After this change, no query is run, and a warning is displayed
in the chart panel body, just like any other error would
validation used to be done in the  component and alter the
redux store as it went. Clearly this is not the right approach, now
validation occurs on loading the initial redux state, as well as in
the reducer when controls are changed
currently, when going from a invalid control state to a valid one
(user addresses what is needed), it auto-triggers a query which can be
unexpected. After this change, the error message disappears, and the
"Run Query" overlay gets displayed
when changing viz type, it's common to get new validation
errors, and currently when that occurs it will still go ahead and run
a query with invalid inputs, which often results in errors
that are not well handled, since much of the logic
assumes control-validated input.
