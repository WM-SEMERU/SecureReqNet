### Description

GitLab has a range of authentication schemes:

* Native username + password -> cookie
* (many other things) -> cookie
* OAuth applications
* Personal access tokens
* Static "private token" stored per-user

There's a lot of overlap between use cases for these mechanisms in the frontend and API.

### Proposal

Of all these schemes, the private token is the least useful and most vulnerable. As far as I can tell, the only use case it has at the moment is access to RSS feeds, along with the `POST /session` endpoint in the API.

I propose we introduce an automatic "issue a token" flow for RSS (we could even have one token per RSS feed), convert /session to something else, then retire private tokens entirely. This could be done in a backward-compatible way, or we could make it part of 9.0 for a clean break.

I don't understand the need to have separate "OAuth tokens" and "personal access tokens". If we could merge those two as well, that'd be great.
