Whenever libxml_use_internal_errors() is called, the previous value for
it should be restored. This used to be the case in this piece of code,
but it was wrongly removed in e53bf58 ,
which has the nasty side effect of making the Validator component test
suite break with this message:
Validation failed: No DTD found!
