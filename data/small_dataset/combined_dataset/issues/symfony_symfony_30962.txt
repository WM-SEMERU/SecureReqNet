Big thanks to @stof for the help with writing the test!
Description
It happens that the IdReader is created by the DoctrineType and cached for each entity class case.
But the type already resolves whether or not it should use it, only when we can optimize query thanks to a single id field when defining the choice_value option: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bridge/Doctrine/Form/Type/DoctrineType.php#L188.
This PR is a first step to optimize the choice loading process.
