I have two projects in GitLab. One has Wiki and Snippets enabled, another doesn't. So header looks busier on second. Because of this, I can't always see number of pending merge requests. 
I believe, this is UI bug.

Number of merge requests for both project is 1 at the moment I took these screenshots.
