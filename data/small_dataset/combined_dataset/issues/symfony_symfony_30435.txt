Hello,
please note, that this PR is a proposal.
Working on an API, I recently needed to return multiple times a new Response() with no body and a 204 (HTTP no content) code.
I'm wordering If adding this new EmptyResponse that would be a shortcut of new Response(null, Reponse::HTTP_NO_CONTENT) would be useful or no.
Please let me know what do you think.
