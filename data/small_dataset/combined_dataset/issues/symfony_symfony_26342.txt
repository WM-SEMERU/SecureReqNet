I have a role called ROLE_OWNER which is a contextual role granted by a custom voter, UserOwnerVoter.
I'm building a somewhat complex privilege system (for a multi-tentant API app where clients will be able to share access to their content to other clients, etc) and need to use unanimous strategy.
In this case, RoleHierarchyVoter (or RoleVoter in general) gets asked if the user is granted the ROLE_OWNER role. But, the role is contextual and cannot be checked like that. What would be useful is to tell RoleVoter to abstain from certain roles, as they're "different".
Currently, I'm working around that by simply not specifying the ROLE_ prefix but, that took some time and debugging to get right (partly because of #26343) and also feels Symfony-ish "If you don't do this special thing, magic (doesn't) happen".
