Add way to specify kubeadm's --ignore-preflight-errors in InitConfiguration and JoinConfiguration


What would you like to be added:
A single way to configure all of kubeadm's behaviour.
In particular, given ignorePreflightErrors and externalcfg are currently disjoint:

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a887ae8344adf9739c1d156a718c05fdf95b73ab/cmd/kubeadm/app/cmd/init.go#L104-L106
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a887ae8344adf9739c1d156a718c05fdf95b73ab/cmd/kubeadm/app/cmd/join.go#L132-L133

I would like a way to specify the set of strings corresponding to --ignore-preflight-errors's value as an "array" in (at least) InitConfiguration and JoinConfiguration.
Why is this needed:
This would simplify programmatic usage of kubeadm: one configuration file to generate, and then pass to kubeadm.
Potential way forward:


Keep --ignore-preflight-errors for backward-compatibility (for now).


Add the following field to both InitConfiguration and JoinConfiguration:
IgnorePreflightErrors []string `json:"ignorePreflightErrors,omitempty"`


Take the union of both sets, validate it (as currently done), and use this going in the rest of the program.


Misc.:
Happy to make the change myself, once I get a "go" (or at least, no "no-go") from someone more knowledgeable. (Maybe @luxas? ðŸ™‚ )
