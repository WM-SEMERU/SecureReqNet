DataTable error when combined with dcc.Tabs


I'm getting an error when creating a DataTable in an app that uses tabs.  I found a similar issue that was popping up when it was still dash_table_experiments  and was able to get a solution to this problem from this community post. That said, I wasn't certain if this is still a bug or not as it looked like this was resolved when dash_table got released and I haven't been able to see any other issues come up for this.
You can reproduce with this minimal example:
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
import dash_table
import pandas as pd


app = dash.Dash(__name__)

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/solar.csv')

app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Tabs(
        id='tabs',
        children=[
            dcc.Tab(
                label='Tab one',
                children=[
                    dash_table.DataTable(
                    id='table',
                    columns=[{"name": i, "id": i} for i in df.columns],
                    data=df.to_dict("rows"),
                )

                ]
                
            ),
            dcc.Tab(
                label='Tab two',
                children=[
                    html.H1('This is tab two')  
                ]
            )
    ])
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
My fix was to create a dummy datatable on the second tab like so:
 dcc.Tab(
                label='Tab two',
                children=[
                    html.H1('This is tab two')  
                    html.Div(
                        dash_table.DataTable(data=[{}], columns=[]),
                        style={'display': 'none'})
                ]
Here are the console error messages I'm getting
