WeakMaps implementation is insecure if two guest frames exchange


Original issue 1520 created by jasvir on 2012-09-07T21:42:27.000Z:
While talking to Mark, we came to realize that the current WeakMaps implementation is vulnerable if two guest frames exchange WeakMaps.  Here is a demonstration of the leak.  This snippet should never call cajaVM.log but does on Chrome (which does not have a native implementation of WeakMap).
caja.initialize({ forceES5Mode: true });
var myMap = { value: undefined };
for (var content in [0,1]) {
caja.load(document.createElement('div'), undefined,
function(frame) {
frame.code("weakmaps-guest.js", "text/javascript",
"if (exchange.value) {" +
"  Object.getOwnPropertyNames(exchange.value)" +
"        .filter(function(x) { return /^rand/.test(x) })" +
"        .map(function(x) { cajaVM.log('fail!  Found secret ' + x) })" +
"} else {" +
"  exchange.value = new WeakMap;" +
"}")
.api(caja.tame({ exchange: myMap }))
.run()
});
}
</script>
