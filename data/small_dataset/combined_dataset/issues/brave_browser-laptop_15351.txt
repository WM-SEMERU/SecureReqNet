Not sure if this is by design, issue with device recognition setting


I've tried searching for this issue, haven't found any mention of it. I'm not sure if this was done by design. When I clear my history the device recognition setting resets. It's not a critical issue, but it is very inconvenient. I apologize for the lack of structure, I am new to Github.
