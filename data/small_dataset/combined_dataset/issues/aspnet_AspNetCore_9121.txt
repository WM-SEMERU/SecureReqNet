MvcCoreLoggerExtensions - Information Leakage Security Vulnerability


Describe the bug
Information leakage found in MVCCoreLoggerExtensions.cs facility.
On line 195 of MvcCoreLoggerExtensions.cs
The action method arguments are logged. MVC applications may contain authentication screens where user sensitive credentials can be obtained from these log files.
To Reproduce
Set up logging in an MVC app, develop a login screen, configure logging at INFO-level and watch the logs spit out user credentials.
Expected behavior
User credentials should never be logged. In fact, any unpredictable data (that is user input) should be left to the implementor to decide if it should be logged. I would think the correct approach is to not log the arguments at all and leave that up to the MVC developer to choose carefully and control that logging on their own.
