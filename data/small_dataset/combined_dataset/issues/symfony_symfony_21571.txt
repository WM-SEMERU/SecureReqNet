[security] "security.authentication.success" event should be fired on every request?


At least that's what the docs say: https://symfony.com/doc/2.8/components/security/authentication.html#authentication-success-and-failure-events

When a provider authenticates the user, a security.authentication.success event is dispatched. But beware - this event will fire, for example, on every request if you have session-based authentication.

The problem is, it doesn't fire for me (?) on Symfony 2.8.12.
Not sure if this is a problem with Symfony, with my code/configuration or just the documentation.
My config (I've cut off what I think are irrelevant parts):
#security.yml
security:

    providers:
        orm:
            entity:
                class: AppBundle:User
                property: username

    firewalls:
        # disables authentication for assets and the profiler, adapt it according to your needs
        dev:
            pattern:  ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
            security: false

        default:
            anonymous: ~
            provider: orm

            form_login:
                login_path: user_login
                check_path: user_login_check
                success_handler: security_login_success_handler
                target_path_parameter: relocate

            remember_me:
                lifetime: 604800 # 1 week in seconds
                always_remember_me: true

    access_control:
        #- { path: ^/login, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY, requires_channel: https }
#config.yml
framework:
    session:
        handler_id:  session.handler.memcached
        cookie_domain: '%auth_cookies_domain%'
