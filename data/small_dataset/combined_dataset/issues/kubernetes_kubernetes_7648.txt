Put Root CA Cert for cluster into all(ish) pods


We could put this into kubeconfig, which would be generated by TokenController, in response to a ServiceAccount (see #7647).
@roberthbailey suggested this in the discussion of #7444.
The alternative would be to automount this into a well-defined location in all pods, using a similar, but distinct admission controller that that used by service accounts.  But this would encourage other, more generic, tls clients (as compared to the special-purpose K8s client) to trust this CA cert.  I don't think I understand all the security risks there.
