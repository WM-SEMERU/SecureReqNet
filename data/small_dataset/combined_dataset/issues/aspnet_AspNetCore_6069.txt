Google+ shutdown will break OAuth provider


The Authentication.Google package implements OAuth2 with Google services. However, it uses Google+ to fetch additional user information.

"The Google+ Sign-in feature is fully deprecated and is being shut down on March 7, 2019. This will be a progressive shutdown, with intermittent failures starting as early as January 28, 2019. Developers should migrate to the more comprehensive Google Sign-in authentication system." ~https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/
This is a patch candidate all the way down to 1.0 and Katana. @muratg @blowdart
Proposals:

Find a new API that will give us basic information like name, e-mail, etc.. It's unlikely the transition would be seamless.
Deprecate the provider and show people how to use OpenIdConnect. This has the benefit of being a docs only change. It may not work for Katana though, we'll have to see if it supported enough ODIC features.
