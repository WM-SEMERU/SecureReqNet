If you try to run the test suite but do not have a redis instance
running, the parent process that was supposed to be killed will never be
as the test is marked as skipped and the store never returned.
This results in the test suite hanging forever at the end.
In this patch, the exception is thrown again, and then caught in the trait, and
the parent gets killed as it should.
