Add a note to indicate PKG_CONFIG_PATH required


I just got the error messages like #23015 again and then I think the root cause should be about
PKG_CONFIG_PATH. After following #23015 (comment) said, I can build Servo successfully.


 ./mach build -d does not report any errors
 ./mach test-tidy does not report any errors
 These changes do not require tests because this just updates README.
