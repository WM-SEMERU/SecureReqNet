"broken" example retrieving the user object


http://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html#retrieving-the-user-object
When updating the docs, I didn't quite take the workings of the security into account. The following example is broken:
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface;

public function indexAction(UserInterface $user)
{
    if (!$this->get('security.authorization_checker')->isGranted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY')) {
        throw $this->createAccessDeniedException();
    }

    // the above is a shortcut for this
    $user = $this->get('security.token_storage')->getToken()->getUser();
}
This will lead to an error unless access_control has already triggered the authentication process to get a user object. The example can be fixed in two ways:

Add an access_control example that triggers security here which populates the object
Add @Security("is_granted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY')") to trigger security before the $user is required

Besides of this, there's a small other issue: // the above is a shortcut for this makes it look like the isGranted is part of the "shortcut", while it's only the type-hint of the method that is part of the shortcut.
