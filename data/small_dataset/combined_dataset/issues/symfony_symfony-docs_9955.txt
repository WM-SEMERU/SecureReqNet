Inconsistent User Entity classes


The User classes shown on pages How to Load Security Users from the Database and How to Implement a Simple Registration Form are inconsistent. For one, the Security Users page includes
    /**
     * @ORM\Column(name="is_active", type="boolean")
     */
    private $isActive;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->isActive = true;
        // may not be needed, see section on salt below
        // $this->salt = md5(uniqid('', true));
    }

whereas the Simple Registration page instead has
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->roles = array('ROLE_USER');
    }

One would expect them either to be the same or to include an explanation for why they are different.
