Design of Security component renders Symfony incompatible with some web services


So I have a WebService which I want to login to. It does all the password hashing, encoding/decoding, comparison, etc on its side when given a username/password. If an authentication attempt is successful, it returns a user profile (aka User object).
Here is why Symfony is incompatible with this scenario:

A UserProvider cannot be built for this webservice, as a profile is only returned when a user/pass pair are sent to the service. The password is not exposed in the loadUserByUsername method.
The login can be performed (with user/pass) in a customer authentication provider, but it then complains that the user provider does not support the User class I am using.
UserInterface requires implementation of getSalt and getPassword. Both of which are irrelevant here.
