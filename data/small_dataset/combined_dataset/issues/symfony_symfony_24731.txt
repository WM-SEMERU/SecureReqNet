One more time I have a "Class __PHP_Incomplete_Class has no unserializer" thanks to security component. It is probably caused by a doctrine relation, the security component wants to serialize a proxy or something, I don't know.
However I implemented \Serializable on my User, and serialize only the ID, so why implement serializable seems completely useless ?
As the doc say, This may or may not be needed depending on your setup, but it's probably a good idea. not very clear...
I still have to do a special object like SecurityUser to log my users, and have to surcharge "user" service, etc... and this solution is not in SF docs (but in some blogs).
After all those years, this serialize thing has always been a balls breaker thing to me. Could you try to simplify it ? Une fois pour toute qu'on en parle plus !
