Simplify/ease the User serialization requirement


(this issue is part of the "DX" ("Developer eXperience") initiative introduced by Symfony project)
In most cases, your User object needs to implement Serializable - we cover it in the docs: http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/entity_provider.html#the-data-model (search What is the importance of serialize and unserialize?). If you don't do this, you may get odd errors if you're using Doctrine.
Could we make this more automatic? The fields that are serialized are important for AbstractToken::hasUserChanged, and unless the developer chooses to explicitly implement EquatableInterface, we know exactly what fields need to be serialized.
In short, the problem is well-defined and is really an ugly implementation detail. So I want to see if we can do this for them, perhaps with an optional AbstractUser.
