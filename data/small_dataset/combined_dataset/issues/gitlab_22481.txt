### Summary

Setting visibility of issues on a public repository to "Only team members" does not fully hide the issues if the repository is in a group, since they will be visible on the group page (which is public).

Example:

Repository with issues not visible:
https://gitlab.com/kada-development/SmsServer-app

Group page, issues are visible (although not accessable):
https://gitlab.com/groups/kada-development/issues

### Steps to reproduce

1. Set issues visibility to "Team members only" in  a group owned repository
2. Go to the (public) page for the group owning the repository.

### Expected behavior

Issues are not visible

### Actual behavior

Issues are visible
