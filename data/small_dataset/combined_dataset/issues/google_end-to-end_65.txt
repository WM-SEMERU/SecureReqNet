Change wording on import dialog to stress the fact that the user must verify the fingerprints of the keys and subkeys being imported.

Is this report about the crypto library or the extension?
Extension
What is the security bug?
We should be more explicit when telling the user to verify the fingerprint of keys before importing them.
How would someone exploit it?
Since subkey's fingerprints aren't as easy to verify, some users might not do it, and import a subkey they don't trust (after just verifying the main key).
We could even add some UI to help the user verify them (checkboxes in the confirmation dialog?). Also, we can hide signed subkeys from the list probably.
(this was reported by kbsriram@ - let me know if we can make this bug public, thanks!)
