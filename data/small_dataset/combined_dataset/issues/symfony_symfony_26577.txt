#26057 updated a test to handle libsodium when the lib is installed.
When it's not installed, the checks of Argon2iPasswordEncoder::isSupported() still returns true if sodium_crypto_pwhash_str() exists and in this case the password value displayed by the command security:encode-password contains $argon2i instead of $argon2id so preg_match() returns false, a notice is emit (Undefined offset: 1) and the test fails.
