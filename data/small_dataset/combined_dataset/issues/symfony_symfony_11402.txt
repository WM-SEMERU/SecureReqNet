Disabling account does not log user out on next request if the logged in user is one being disabled


Disabling the users account who is logged in will not log them out in the next request that they make. However, if a different user disables a different account such as an admin disabling a users account then the user being disabled will be logged out automatically on the next request the newly disabled user makes.
This seems to cause confusion for developers when say a logged-in user is disabling their own account. It would be great if the next request would then follow the same logic as if the user account was disabled by a different user. Without this working the same as if some other user disables a users account you must manually set the token to null to log the user out. You then lose the security firewall logic for how to handle invalid tokens.
I think a beginner would have some challenges with with this but maybe I'm mistaken. Thoughts and input?
