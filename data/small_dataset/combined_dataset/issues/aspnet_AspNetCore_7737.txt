Session is not invalidated on server side after logout


We did a security audit with a pentest company and will be informed that the applications logout procedure is insufficient. They criticized that when you click on Logout, the cookie .AspNetCore.Identity.Application gets deleted on client-side, but the server-side session stays intact. They tested this by setting the original auth-cookie value manually after logout and got response from the server like being logged in.
To Reproduce
Used version of ASP.NET Core: 2.2.
Code of the logout function:
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task<IActionResult> LogOff()
{
	await _signInManager.SignOutAsync();
	HttpContext.Session.Clear();
	_logger.LogInformation(4, "User logged out.");

	return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
}

So what I am doing wrong and what is the correct way to logout?
