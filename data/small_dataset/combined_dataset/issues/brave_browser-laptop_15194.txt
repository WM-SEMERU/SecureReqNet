Fix about:blank appearing on new tab in new windows


fix #15162
openableByContextMenu returned false if URL is empty for paranoia
reasons, but it turns out this breaks some edge cases. See
#15061 for instance.
Test Plan:

unit tests pass
on MacOS, close all windows
click 'New tab'
new window should appear and show the new tab page
repeat step 3 and 4 with private tab, tor tab, session tab, and new window
