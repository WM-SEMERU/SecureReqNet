Limit response compression based on response size


Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I am using the AddResponseCompression available in ASP.NET Core.
The issue I am facing now is, even if the response size is too small, the response is being compressed. Is it possible to limit compression based on the response size?
Describe the solution you'd like
Add a parameter to the AddResponseCompression, namely Size (similar to EnableForHttps) which stops compression if the response size is less than the specified Size value.
Describe alternatives you've considered
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
Additional context
We were using the below package earlier,
https://github.com/azzlack/Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.MessageHandlers.Compression
They seem to have the ability to pass in a value, based on which it halts the compression process.
