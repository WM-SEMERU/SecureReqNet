Regex of UrlMatcher broken or my failure?


Symfony version(s) affected: x.y.z
Description
When i run our tests on symfony-cmf/routing i  got the following issue:
3) Symfony\Cmf\Component\Routing\Tests\Unit\NestedMatcher\UrlMatcherTest::testMatchNoRouteObject
preg_match(): No ending delimiter '/' found
/home/travis/build/symfony-cmf/Routing/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Routing/Matcher/UrlMatcher.php:155
/home/travis/build/symfony-cmf/Routing/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Routing/Matcher/UrlMatcher.php:87
/home/travis/build/symfony-cmf/Routing/src/NestedMatcher/UrlMatcher.php:42
/home/travis/build/symfony-cmf/Routing/tests/Unit/NestedMatcher/UrlMatcherTest.php:145

When i debug into the code i see that our regex comming from the route #\/foo\/bar# is replaced through the follwoing str_replace() by a mechanism i do not understand $pos (int) - $hasTrailingSash(bool) to /?$\/foo\/bar
How to reproduce
The easiest way would be to run the tests of that branch:
https://github.com/symfony-cmf/Routing/blob/master/tests/Unit/NestedMatcher/UrlMatcherTest.php#L143
and follow from that line. That branch simply prepares a stricter php handling and opens for tests with SF 4.2. Otherwise i would try to reproduce it in an other way.
