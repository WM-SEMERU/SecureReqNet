Ability to add sidecar containers to static pod manifests


Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?
FEATURE REQUEST
It would be helpful if kubeadm had the ability add additional containers to the generated static pod manifests. For example, adding the aws-encryption-provider to the apiserver pod.
Example:
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  extraArgs:
    cloud-provider: "aws"
  extraContainers:
    - name: aws-encryption-provider
      image: k8s.gcr.io/aws-encryption-provider:v0.1.0
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: "200Mi"
        requests:
          memory: "100Mi"
You could have a fixed one-off just for encryption provider support, however having this be generic could provide a solution to other use cases down the road.
