Symfony\Component\Security\Http\RememberMe\AbstractRememberMeServices
Method: isRememberMeRequested
Line: 322
Comment: Seems practical to equate a boolean, not just string values. Function returns a boolean; should equate a boolean.
Why: I am using an external form to log in users. I overwrote the remember me parameter as a boolean in a sub request. Remember me stopped working, this appears to be the cause of the issue.
Notes: Using Silex 2.0. I understand this parameter should be the value of a checkbox but for better flexibility I don't see the harm in equating a boolean as well.
