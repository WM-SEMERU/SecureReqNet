Member cannot login to their account : user do not have document access


Dear All,
We have received a lot of our platform users report that they cannot login to their account.
Just happneded in yesterday , our admin did not change anything on setting or touch anything on the premission.
Here is the error message, when the members tried to log in:
"user do not have document access"
Does anyone has the solution ?
Cheers!
Cat
