Add unsecured /health endpoint, remove auth checks from isLeader


This PR adds a new /health endpoint on all services, intended for external health checks issued to Druid services.
This endpoint is unsecured, as external health checks do not necessarily support attaching authentication credentials (e.g., those issued by Amazon ELB).
This PR also removes auth checks from the "/isLeader" endpoints on coordinators and overlords, for similar external compatibility reasons.
