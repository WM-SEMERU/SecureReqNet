When using a NamedAddress in from(), the generated MessageId don't pass the validation.
In effect, the email passed to generateMessageId look like this Fabien <fabien@symfony.com> and the strstr transform email in this 4641b2b294b53fe983a05b1a@symfony.com>
By passing the address only instead of toString, it's fixed.
