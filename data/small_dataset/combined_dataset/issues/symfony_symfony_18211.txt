There is a nice class in Symfony that is used to check whether a token is anonymously: AuthenticationTrustResolver. However, its logic was still hard coded in the ContextListener, making it impossible to customize it (e.g. using another anonymous token class). I think it makes lots of sense to use the dedicated class.
