brave not starting due: cannot change mount namespace of snap




 Yes I did try the new version
apt update && apt dist-upgrade done


 I believe this issue is critical for users (security issue, bug that prevents folks from using the software)
yeah, cannot access my browser


 I've read the FAQs and Common Issues section on community.brave.com (https://community.brave.com/c/common-issues)
found similarly named issue there but error messages are totally different


After months of very good experience using Brave just now it stopped opening.
To reproduce

clicking brave icon from launcher
or starting brave from shell

The latter produce:
main.go:224: cannot change mount namespace of snap "brave" according to change mount (/snap/gtk-common-themes/818/share/icons/Suru /snap/brave/44/data-dir/icons/Suru none bind,ro 0 0): cannot use "/snap/gtk-common-themes/818/share/icons/Suru" as bind-mount source: not a directory
