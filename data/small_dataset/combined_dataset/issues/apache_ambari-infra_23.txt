What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Change the rolling file appenders log entry pattern: log date-time to ISO8601 format, log java file and line number
Eliminate log4j 1 dependencies and use log4j-1.2-api for 3rd party components which are depends on log4j 1
Add 'log4j-web' to eliminate warning

2018-12-04 15:52:10,943 main INFO Log4j appears to be running in a Servlet environment, but there's no log4j-web module available. If you want better web container support, please add the log4j-web JAR to your web archive or server lib directory.

Since this log entry is in a different format it caused Logfeeder to stop parsing infra manager logs.
