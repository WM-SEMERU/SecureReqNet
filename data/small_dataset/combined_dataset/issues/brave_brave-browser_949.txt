Describe the issue you encountered:
If you use autofill data to fill in a form with hidden fields, they get populated either.
This is a security risk since unaware users can give their information to a malicious website.
Expected behavior:
We shouldn't autofill data for any type of hidden fields


Platform (Win7, 8, 10? macOS? Linux distro?): n/a


Brave Version (revision SHA): n/a


Steps to reproduce:

Have all autofill data filled
Go to this site: https://anttiviljami.github.io/browser-autofill-phishing/
Autofill fields
Open devTools > Network > Click on the .html file > Headers tab
Form data was all filled even if you can only see name/email
