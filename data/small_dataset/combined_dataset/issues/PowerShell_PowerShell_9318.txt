unicode variable name garbled


1 I cannot determine the source of the problem. I suspect that it is related to the powershell engine.
Please help find the cause and change the issue title.
2 Looks unrelated to psreadline.

note:
There is a tab before each line of code.
Delete the tab in front of each line of code, the garbled disappears.
Only affect the paste code in the console, in the ps1 script, there is no such problem.

	$t1, $t2 = top -b -d 2 -n 2 | grep Cpu
	[decimal]$t11 = $t1.replace('id,', '乂').split('乂')[0].replace('ni,', '乂').split('乂')[1]
	[decimal]$t12 = $t2.replace('id,', '乂').split('乂')[0].replace('ni,', '乂').split('乂')[1]
	$t11
	$t12
	$aaaa = ($t11 + $t12) / 2
	$aaaa

	$cpu空闲值百分比_实时_所有核心 = ($t11 + $t12) / 2
	$cpu空闲值百分比_实时_所有核心
