compileExpr lacks Unicode whitespace gimmick


Original issue 1826 created by kpreid.switchb.org on 2013-07-30T17:17:20.000Z:
r5468 forces rerendering in compileModule if there is funny whitespace, in order to obtain a source string which omits it. However, compileModule is not a bottleneck for eval; there is also compileExpr. Thus, cajaVM.compileExpr('1\u2000') fails whereas cajaVM.compileModule('1\u2000') correctly succeeds.
We should make sure that compileExpr and compileModule behave the same outside of the syntactic distinction they are intended to make. Perhaps some refactoring?
