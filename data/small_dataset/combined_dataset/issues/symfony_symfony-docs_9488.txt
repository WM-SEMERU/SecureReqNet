csrf_token now can be used without installing the Form component


This fixes #9485.
@xabbuh in your original code (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/25197/files) the function was added to Twig Bridge so ... could you please verify if installing just security-csrf is enough to use this function or if we need to install some other package? Thanks!
