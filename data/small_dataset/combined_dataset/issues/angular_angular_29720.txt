Update bazel builder


build: update angular cli packages to latest beta
feat(bazel): update the build to use the new architect api
With this change the builder has been updated to use the latest architect API and make it compatible with the latest CLI
Fixes angular/angular-cli#14082
refactor: use standard node resolution methods where possible
This aligns with the CLI as we'd like to use standard node resolutions when possible angular/angular-cli#14029
This also makes the builder run on windows
