Redirect on login


I have the following security firewall config:
firewalls:
        admin_area:
            pattern: ^/admin
            anonymous: ~
            provider: admin_provider
            form_login:
                check_path:  acme_admin.security.check
                login_path:  acme_admin.security.login
                use_forward: true
                remember_me: true
            logout:
                path:   acme_admin.security.logout
                target: admin_homepage
            remember_me:
                key:      %secret%
                lifetime: 1209600 # 2 weeks
The "use_forward" is set to true. However, if I open up 2 page tabs.

/secure/link1 (opened first)
/secure/link2 (opened second)

Both will display the login form. However, if I login on /secure/link2 (which was opened second), the page redirects to /secure/link1 rather than /secure/link2.
The page is redirected to the value stored in the session here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Authentication/DefaultAuthenticationSuccessHandler.php#L98
If I am using use_forward shouldn't it always use the url in the browser rather than session etc?
