Binding Secure cookies to ITlsTokenBindingFeature


Any protected cookie marked as Secure should also use ITlsTokenBindingFeature as part of its protection.
Today CookieAuth always uses ITlsTokenBindingFeature if it's available, ignoring CookieSecureOption. Check CookieSecureOption before applying ITlsTokenBindingFeature.
Other protected data to consider:
OAuth state field
OIDC state fields
OIDC nonce
Twitter request token
