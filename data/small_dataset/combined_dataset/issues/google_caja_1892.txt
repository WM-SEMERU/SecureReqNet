no log output for removed tags if they are unrecognized


Original issue 1894 created by benjaminrk on 2014-02-20T21:53:30.000Z:
What revision of the cajoler exhibits the problem?  On what browser and OS?
r5661, Chrome 34, OS X 10.9
What steps will reproduce the problem?

html_sanitize("<embed></embed>", passthrough, passthrough, console.log);

What is the expected output?
"embed removed", just like "script removed" for a script tag
What do you see instead?
no output
Please provide any additional information below.
Specific issue is that there is no log output when 'embed' tags are stripped, because 'embed' tag is not included in the html4.ELEMENTS container. General issue is that there is no output when elements are scrubbed because they are unrecognized tags. This can be fixed in makeTagPolicy by adding html4.ELEMENTS[tagName] !== undefined condition.
