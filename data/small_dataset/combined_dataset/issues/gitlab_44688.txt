### Summary

The group CI/CD settings are accessible by members with a `Master` role even though all other group settings are locked down to the `Owner` role. They have to use the URL directly as the `Settings` menu is hidden from them at the group view.

### Steps to reproduce

Navigate to a group with `Master` role permissions and the `Settings` menu is not visible.

Navigate to the same group's CI/CD setting's URL (https://gitlab.com/groups/`$GROUP`/-/settings/ci_cd) and all the variable are accessible with read/write permissions.
