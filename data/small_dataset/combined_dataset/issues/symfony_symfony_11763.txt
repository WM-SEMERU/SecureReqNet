BasicAuthenticationListener has private properties


Hi there,
I would like to implement a (slightly) different basic authentication header mechanism and therefore inherited the new authentication listener from BasicAuthenticationListener. In the inherited one, I need access to the properties $securityContext and $providerKey. Those are private, though.
To make them available, I introduced the two parameters in the inherited listener again, making them protected this time. To grab the values, I had to overload the constructor, though.
Is the BasicAuthenticationListener considered final or should the properties be protected?
Thanks for looking into that!
Best,
Thomas
